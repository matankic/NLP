Leinster_group,Start,1,"In mathematics, a Leinster group is a finite group whose order equals the sum of the orders of its proper normal subgroups.
The Leinster groups are named after Tom Leinster, a mathematician at the University of Edinburgh, who wrote about them in a paper written in 1996 but not published until 2001. He called them ""perfect groups"" and later ""immaculate groups"",
but they were renamed as the Leinster groups by De Medts & Maróti (2013) because ""perfect group"" already had a different meaning (a group that equals its commutator subgroup).
Leinster groups give a group-theoretic way of analyzing the perfect numbers and of approaching the still-unsolved problem of the existence of odd perfect numbers.
For a cyclic group, the orders of the subgroups are just the divisors of the order of the group,
so a cyclic group is a Leinster group if and only if its order is a perfect number. More strongly, as Leinster proved, an abelian group is a Leinster group if and only if it is a cyclic group whose order is a perfect number. Moreover Leinster showed that dihedral Leinster groups are in one-to-one correspondence with odd perfect numbers, so the existence of odd perfect numbers is equivalent to the existence of dihedral Leinster groups.


== Examples ==
The cyclic groups whose order is a perfect number are Leinster groups.
It is possible for a non-abelian Leinster group to have odd order; an example of order 355433039577 was constructed by François Brunault.
Other examples of non-abelian Leinster groups include certain groups of the form

Dry_heat_sterilization,Start,1,"Dry heat sterilization of an object is one of the earliest forms of sterilization practiced. It uses hot air that is either free from water vapor or has very little of it, where this moisture plays a minimal or no role in the process of sterilization.


== Process ==
The dry heat sterilization process is accomplished by conduction; that is where heat is absorbed by the exterior surface of an item and then passed inward to the next layer. Eventually, the entire item reaches the proper temperature needed to achieve sterilization. The proper time and temperature for dry heat sterilization is 160 °C (320 °F) for 2 hours or 170 °C (340 °F) for 1 hour, and in the case of High Velocity Hot Air sterilisers, 190°C (375°F) for 6 to 12 minutes.
Items should be dry before sterilization since water will interfere with the process. Dry heat destroys microorganisms by causing denaturation of proteins.

The presence of moisture, such as in steam sterilization, significantly speeds up heat penetration.
There are two types of hot air convection (Convection refers to the circulation of heated air within the chamber of the oven) sterilizers: 

Gravity convection
Mechanical convection


=== Mechanical convection process ===
A mechanical convection oven contains a blower that actively forces heated air throughout all areas of the chamber. The flow created by the blower ensures uniform temperatures and the equal transfer of heat throughout the load. For this reason, the mechanical convection oven is the more efficient of the two processes.


=== High Velocity Hot Air ===
An even more efficient system than convection uses deturbulized hot air forced through a jet curtain at 3000ft/minute.


== Instruments used for dry heat sterilization ==
Instruments and techniques used for dry heat sterilization include hot air ovens, incinerators, flaming, radiation, and glass bead sterilizers.


== Effect on microorganisms ==
Dry heat lyses the proteins in any organism, causes oxidative free radical damage, causes drying of cells, and can even burn them to ashes, as in incineration.

Hospices_of_Hope,Start,1,"Hospices of Hope is a non-profit organisation which aims to provide palliative care services to adults and children with terminal and life-limiting illnesses in Southeastern Europe. The main areas of delivery are Romania, Serbia, and Moldova. Hospices of Hope also provides training and education programmes in countries outside of the core provision.
The organisation is headquartered in Otford, Kent, in the United Kingdom.


== History ==
After visiting Romania before and after the Revolution of 1989, founder, Graham Perolls OBE, CMG, learned of the nonexistence of palliative care in the country. Having previously established the Ellenor Foundation in 1985 which built a hospice in Dartford, Kent, the organisation started fundraising for palliative care provisions in Romania. The Ellenor Foundation was behind operations in Romania until 2000 when that part took on its independent identity, Hospices of Hope. Most fundraising activities contributed to training programmes which was provided by UK nurses until 1997 when an education centre was opened and run in large part by Romanian nurses trained under previous programmes run by the charity. In 2002, its first in-patient hospice was built in Brasov.


== Scope of Work ==


=== Romania ===


==== HOSPICE Casa Sperantei, Brasov ====
Founded in 1992, Casa Sperantei provides care for people living with terminal illnesses and children with a range of life-limiting illnesses with a team also serving the capital, Bucharest. There also exists an education programme to aid the development of palliative care nationally and in neighbouring Balkan countries. The hospice works to develop a national strategy for palliative care with the Ministry of Health.


==== Hospice Casa Sperantei Rural Teams ====
These teams operate in the Fagara and Zarnesti regions and provide palliative care in the form of home visits.


==== HOSPICE Casa Sperantei ""Princess Diana"" Education Centre, Brasov ====
Established in 1997, this centre is accredited by Ministry of Public Health as the National Study and Resource Centre for Palliative Care. In 2000, it became the Regional Palliative Care Training Centre for South-Eastern Europe.


==== Hospice Casa Sperantei, Bucharest ====
HOSPICE Casa Sperantei, Bucharest, was established in 2005. It delivered care via medical teams which provided home and hospital visits. Bucharest's first out-patient clinic opened in 2007. In 2014, a new hospice was built in the Romanian capital.


=== Serbia ===
Hospices of Hope supports Belhospice which was established in 2004 by Dr. Natasa Milicevic. In 2006 the Prue Dufour medical educational centre was established.


=== Moldova ===
Hospices of Hope Moldova supports existing palliative care organisations in the regions of Orhei, Soroca, and Ocnita. Medical supplies such as stoma bags and prosthetic breasts are also sent to Moldova from UK donations.

Guardian_of_the_Threshold,Start,1,"The Guardian of the Threshold is a menacing figure that is described by a number of esoteric teachers. The term ""Guardian of the Threshold"", often called ""Dweller on the Threshold"", indicates a spectral image which is supposed to manifest itself as soon as ""the student of the spirit ascends upon the path into the higher worlds of knowledge"". The Guardian of the Threshold is also the title of the third play (of a tetralogy of Mystery Dramas) written by Rudolf Steiner in 1912.


== According to theosophy ==

The ""Dweller of the Threshold"" (or ""Guardian of the Threshold"") as a literary invention of the English mystic and novelist Edward Bulwer-Lytton is found in his romance Zanoni (1842). After the founding of the Theosophical Society in 1875, the term gained wide currency in theosophical circles. The Guardian of the Threshold is a spectral figure and is the abstract of the debit and credit book of the individual. ""It is the combined evil influence that is the result of the wicked thoughts and acts of the age in which any one may live, and it assumes to each student a definite shape at each appearance, being always either of one sort or changing each time"" 
""This Dweller of the Threshold meets us in many shapes. It is the Cerberus guarding the entrance to Hades; the Dragon which St. Michael (spiritual will-power) is going to kill; the Snake which tempted Eve, and whose head will be crushed by the heel of the woman; the Hobgoblin watching the place where the treasure is buried, etc. He is the king of evil, who will not permit that within his kingdom a child should grow up, which might surpass him in power; the Herod before whose wrath the divine child Christ has to flee into a foreign country, and is not permitted to return to his home (the soul) until the king (Ambition, Pride, Vanity, Self-righteousness, etc.) is dethroned or dead."" 
According to Max Heindel, the Dweller on the Threshold must be confronted by every aspirant—usually at an early stage of his progress into the unseen worlds—and is one of the main causes of obsession.


== In Rudolf Steiner's drama ==
In Rudolf Steiner's play The Guardian of the Threshold, first performed in 1912 and the third in a series of four ""Mystery Dramas"", the appearance of the Guardian is connected with Lucifer and Ahriman.[5] Steiner explained that the meeting with the Guardian of the Threshold as presented in those dramas was to show that a person (man or woman) who had made the soul clairvoyant, must go back and forth across that threshold and know how to be rightly in the spiritual world on the far side, as well as on this side in the physical world.

Piggybacking_(security),Start,1,"In security, piggybacking, similar to tailgating, refers to when a person tags along with another person who is authorized to gain entry into a restricted area, or pass a certain checkpoint. It can be either electronic or physical. The act may be legal or illegal, authorized or unauthorized, depending on the circumstances. However, the term more often has the connotation of being an illegal or unauthorized act.
To describe the act of an unauthorized person who follows someone to a restricted area without the consent of the authorized person, the term tailgating is also used. ""Tailgating"" implies no consent (similar to a car tailgating another vehicle on a road), while ""piggybacking"" usually implies consent of the authorized person.
Piggybacking came to the public's attention particularly in 1999, when a series of weaknesses were exposed in airport security. A study showed that the majority of undercover agents attempting to pass through checkpoints, bring banned items on planes, or board planes without tickets were successful. Piggybacking was revealed as one of the methods that were used in order to enter off-limits areas.


== Methods ==


=== Electronic ===

A user fails to properly log off their computer, allowing an unauthorized user to ""piggyback"" on the authorized user's session.
Using authorized shared or common log in credentials to gain access to systems


=== Physical ===
Piggybackers have various methods of breaching security. These may include:

Surreptitiously following an individual authorized to enter a location, giving the appearance of being legitimately escorted
Joining a large crowd authorized to enter, and pretending to be a member of the crowd that is largely unchecked
Finding an authorized person who either disregards the law or the rules of the facility, or is tricked into believing the piggybacker is authorized, and agreeably allows the piggybacked to tag along
Donning counterfeit identification badges or cards to seamlessly integrate into the environment
Gaining access through alternative entrances like rear or side doors, such as those found in parking lots
Piggybacking can be regarded as one of the simpler forms of social engineering.

International_Federation_of_Rock_Art_Organizations,Start,1,"The International Federation of Rock Art Organizations (IFRAO) is a coordinating body of 60 organizations concerned with prehistoric rock art.  


== History ==
The IFRAO was formed in Darwin, Australia on 3 September 1988, during the first major international academic conference dedicated entirely to the study of prehistoric rock art. Nine rock art organizations formed this international federation of independent national or regional bodies. At the founding meeting, it was decided that IFRAO should be a common forum and initiator of policies, projecting or representing the common interests of member organizations without interfering in their autonomy. It would operate as a democratic advisory body in which each member organization would hold one vote, exercised by an official representative. International meetings would be held by nominating suitable rock art conferences as official IFRAO congresses at regular intervals. 
Over the subsequent twelve years, the number of affiliate members quadrupled to almost 40, and the current 60 members of IFRAO cover most of the world. The combined memberships of these organizations include about 9,000 rock art specialists, which is practically all such specialists in the world. 
Until the late 1980s, individual rock art researchers as well as rock art organizations around the world operated largely without being aware of the work conducted in other parts of the world — sometimes even in their own country or region of activity. As a result, the discipline experienced a great diversity of research approaches and terminology, reflected in a multitude of idiosyncratic constructs, sequences, chronologies, names and definitions. Therefore, one of IFRAO’s initial principal concerns was the standardization of those aspects of the discipline that are essential for effective communication and collaboration: methodology, terminology, ethics, and the technical standards used in analysis and recording. These subjects were addressed through extensive consultation of specialists and, where appropriate, the deliberations of appointed subcommittees.


== Objectives ==
The IFRAO members produce about twenty specialist periodicals, whose flagship is Rock Art Research, the official organ of the federation. IFRAO has been particularly effective in the area of rock art protection and preservation, achieving sometimes spectacular successes, such as the electoral defeat of recalcitrant Portuguese governments in 1995 and 2002. Subsequently IFRAO secured the preservation and return to Aborigines of the reputedly largest rock art gallery in the world, in the Dampier Archipelago of Western Australia, against bitter opposition from the State Government and 18 multinational companies. Thus the federation has become the principal international body pursuing the conservation of prehistoric rock art effectively. Another of its greatest achievements to date has been its successful campaign of empowering traditional indigenous societies to secure the return of rock art sites into their care and possession.

We Are Toonz released Drop That #NaeNae in 2013 without much fanfare. The group posted a video of themselves performing the #NaeNae Dance on the social video sharing website Vine and other social media websites like Instagram, Twitter and YouTube. As the song gained momentum the Drop That #NaeNae went viral. The Michigan State Football team can be seen dropping that #NaeNae on YouTube, and breaking down the #NaeNae dance on Vine. Video postings from other college teams dropping that #NaeNae to foster team spirit started going viral as well, Ohio State, Temple University, Auburn University, Notre Dame, and Mercer Bear basketball team victory #NaeNae over Duke's Blue Devils.
Houston Rockets', Dwight Howard posted videos of himself dropping the #NaeNae. After which, he reached out to the group to record a video in Atlanta. Washington Wizards', John Wall celebrated his slam dunk contest win by dropping that ""NaeNae"" with Paul George. Due to the Vines, videos and GIFs the group saw a 311% spike in mentions of the #NaeNae hashtag.
In August 2014, Coca-Cola released a commercial featuring We Are Toonz for their Ahh Campaign targeting the teen and young adult demographic. We Are Toonz are the first hip-hop act to collaborate with Coca-Cola since R&B singer Tyrese Gibson. The group was selected by the brand after seeing them perform at the World of Coke Ahh stage at the 2013 BET Hip-Hop Awards.

Monitor_mode,Start,1,"Monitor mode, or RFMON (Radio Frequency MONitor) mode, allows a computer with a wireless network interface controller (WNIC) to monitor all traffic received on a wireless channel. Unlike promiscuous mode, which is also used for packet sniffing, monitor mode allows packets to be captured without having to associate with an access point or ad hoc network first. Monitor mode only applies to wireless networks, while promiscuous mode can be used on both wired and wireless networks. Monitor mode is one of the eight modes that 802.11 wireless adapter can operate in: Master (acting as an access point), Managed (client, also known as station), Ad hoc, Repeater, Mesh, Wi-Fi Direct, TDLS and Monitor mode.


== Uses ==
Uses for monitor mode include: geographical packet analysis, observing of widespread traffic and acquiring knowledge of Wi-Fi technology through hands-on experience. It is especially useful for auditing unsecure channels (such as those protected with WEP). Monitor mode can also be used to help design Wi-Fi networks. For a given area and channel, the number of Wi-Fi devices currently being used can be discovered. This helps to create a better Wi-Fi network that reduces interference with other Wi-Fi devices by choosing the least used Wi-Fi channels.
Software such as KisMAC or Kismet, in combination with packet analyzers that can read pcap files, provide a user interface for passive wireless network monitoring.


== Limitations ==
Usually the wireless adapter is unable to transmit in monitor mode and is restricted to a single wireless channel, though this is dependent on the wireless adapter's driver, its firmware, and features of its chipset. Also, in monitor mode the adapter does not check to see if the cyclic redundancy check (CRC) values are correct for packets captured, so some captured packets may be corrupted.


== Operating system support ==
The Microsoft Windows Network Driver Interface Specification (NDIS) API has supported extensions for monitor mode since NDIS version 6, first available in Windows Vista.  NDIS 6 supports exposing 802.11 frames to the upper protocol levels, while previous versions only exposed fake Ethernet frames translated from the 802.11 frames. Monitor mode support in NDIS 6 is an optional feature and may or may not be implemented in the client adapter driver. The implementation details and compliance with the NDIS specifications vary from vendor to vendor. In many cases, monitor mode support is not properly implemented by the vendor. For example, Ralink drivers report incorrect dBm readings and Realtek drivers do not include trailing 4-byte CRC values.
For versions of Windows prior to Windows Vista, some packet analyzer applications such as Wildpackets' OmniPeek and TamoSoft's CommView for WiFi provide their own device drivers to support monitor mode.
Linux's interfaces for 802.11 drivers support monitor mode and many drivers offer that support. STA drivers (Ralink, Broadcom) and every other manufacturer’s provided driver doesn’t support monitor mode.
FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, and DragonFly BSD also provide an interface for 802.11 drivers that supports monitor mode, and many drivers for those operating systems support monitor mode as well.  In Mac OS X 10.4 and later releases, the drivers for AirPort Extreme network adapters allow the adapter to be put into monitor mode.  Libpcap 1.0.0 and later provides an API to select monitor mode when capturing on those operating systems.

Homosphere,Start,1,"The homosphere is the layer of an atmosphere where the bulk gases are homogeneously mixed due to turbulent mixing or eddy diffusion. The bulk composition of the air is mostly uniform so the concentrations of molecules are the same throughout the homosphere. The top of the homosphere is called the homopause, also known as the turbopause. Above the homopause is the heterosphere, where diffusion is faster than mixing, and heavy gases decrease in density with altitude more rapidly than lighter gases.
Some of the processes driving this uniformity include heating convection and air flow patterns. In the troposphere, rising warm air replaces higher cooler air which mix gases vertically. Wind patterns push air across the surface mixing it horizontally. At higher altitudes, other atmospheric circulation regimes exist, such as the Brewer-Dobson circulation in the terrestrial stratosphere, which mixes the air. In Earth's mesophere, atmospheric waves become unstable and dissipate, creating turbulent mixing of this region.


== Earth's homosphere ==

The Earth's homosphere starts at the Earth's surface and extends to the turbopause at about 90 km (56 mi). It incorporates all of the troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, and the lower part of the thermosphere. Chemically the homosphere is composed of 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and trace amounts of other molecules, such as argon and carbon dioxide. It contains over 99% of the mass of the Earth's atmosphere. The density of air decreases with height in the homosphere.  By definition & notably, it also includes a 10 km (6 mi) thick band of elemental mesosphere sodium.


=== Variations in concentration ===
One large-scale exception to effective mixing is the ozone layer, centered at about 20 - 30 km (12.5 - 19 mi) in altitude, where the concentration of O3 is much higher than in the rest of the atmosphere. This is due to incoming ultraviolet light, which turns O2 into O3. This created ozone itself blocks most ultraviolet light from penetrating to lower layers of the atmosphere and creating similar levels of ozone there. With a half-life of about a day at room temperature, ozone breaks down before it can mix completely with the lower levels of the atmosphere.  The ozone hole is a relatively stable structure caused by a combination of pollution and antarctic wind patterns in the stratosphere.
Water vapor concentration (humidity) varies considerably, especially in the troposphere, and is a major component of weather. Water evaporation is driven by heat from incoming solar radiation, and temperature variations can cause water-saturated air to expunge water in the form of rain, snow, or fog. The heat gained and lost by water through these processes increases turbulence in the lower atmosphere, especially at mesoscale and microscale. The Brewer–Dobson circulation is a theory of large-scale ozone circulation.
Concentrations of other trace gases are higher near natural and artificial sources. This includes pollution from human activity (especially agriculture, industry, and transportation), natural gas fields, radon produced by radioactive decay in certain minerals, volcanic gas, emissions from limnic eruptions. Oxygen is emitted and carbon dioxide is absorbed by plants and microorganisms performing photosynthesis, but CO2 levels are most strongly affected by wild fires and human activity.

Labels are awarded to qualifying institutions under the names are Eurobachelor and Euromaster, as well as the proposed Eurodoctorate. Label Committee not only prepares for the ECTN Administrative Council proposals to award the Eurolabels but also judge the quality of chemical education programmes at HEIs. ECTN and its Label Committee closely collaborates with EuCheMS and American Chemical Society.
It is a framework which is supported by EuCheMS, and the labels are awarded by ECTN. The project is supported by the European Commission (EC) through its SOCRATES programme. The purpose of the framework is to ""promote recognition of first, second cycle degrees, and third cycle degrees not only within the 45 countries involved in the Bologna process"".


== History ==
European Union promoted the Bologna process and the creation of a single European higher education area, both of which require mobility of graduates across Europe.
ECTN (European Chemistry Thematic Network) worked in the EU project ""Tuning Educational Structures in Europe"" and developed Eurobachelor, a framework for a first cycle qualification (first degree) in chemistry. EuCheMS approved Eurobachelor in October 2003.
In June 2004 the Bologna process seminar ""Chemistry Studies in the European Higher Education Area"" approved Eurobachelor.

Cadillac_High_Technology_engine,Start,1,"The Cadillac High Technology Engine was a V8 engine produced by the Cadillac division of General Motors from 1982 to 1995.
While the High Technology engine was being developed, due to higher Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards being phased in by the United States government, Cadillac introduced a variant of their traditional V8 engine with the first usage of cylinder deactivation for 1981 as a stopgap measure to increase the fuel economy of their lineup.
However, the V8-6-4 engine experienced problems in reliability related to cylinder deactivation. GM released EPROM updates hoping to increase drivability and reliability, but could not overcome the primitive state of engine control technologies at the time, and the V8-6-4 was discontinued for 1982, with many owners disconnecting the cylinder deactivation system. Cadillac, who planned to introduce their new engine in a line of front-wheel drive models for 1983, was then forced to rush development and production of the High Technology engine for a 1982 introduction in their current rear-wheel drive models.
For nearly 25 years, the High Technology V8 line was known as the last engine family exclusive to the Cadillac Motor Car Division because its successor, the Northstar, would go on to share its architecture with the Oldsmobile Aurora in 1994 and later with flagship Pontiac and Buick models, such as the Pontiac Bonneville and Buick Lucerne. However, in 2019, the Cadillac Blackwing V8 became the new holder of that title.


== HT-4100 ==

A new lighter V8 engine was rushed into production for 1982, the HT-4100 (option code LT8). It was a 4100 cc V8, designed for rear-wheel drive and longitudinal front-wheel drive applications sharing the same ""Metric"" transmission bellhousing pattern as  Buick, Oldsmobile, and Pontiac rear- and front-wheel drivetrains for 2.5 L 4-cylinder and 2.8, 3.1, and 3.3 L V6. A new line of downsized Cadillacs with the transverse mounted V8 engine and front wheel-drive was slated for launch in 1983, however, delays in the downsizing program shared with Buick and Oldsmobile postponed their debut until mid 1984 when they were introduced as early 1985 models.


=== Design Features ===
HT stood for High Technology. For its time, the engine and its electronic control module (ECM) were quite sophisticated, despite having a throttle-body fuel injection system (as opposed to more advanced multiport fuel injection). Like the 6.0/368"" DFI engines before it, the HT4100 used an ECM that incorporated a detailed on-board computer. Every parameter of engine performance could be displayed on the Electronic Climate Control panel while the car was being driven. The HT4100 also adopted other modern design features including replaceable  cylinder sleeves, high operating temperature for emission control (210 degrees, compared to 180 in earlier engines), free circulation of coolant between the block and the heads, and bimetal construction that mounted heat-tolerant cast-iron heads onto a weight-saving aluminum block. The engine had a bore and stroke of 88 mm × 84 mm (3.465 in × 3.307 in), for a total displacement of 4.1 L; 249.4 cu in (4,087 cc). It produced 135 hp (101 kW) at 4400 rpm and 190 lb⋅ft (258 N⋅m) of torque at 2000 rpm.
In 1982, the HT4100 debuted as the standard engine for all Cadillac models except the new compact Cimarron, and the Fleetwood limousines, which continued to carry the variable displacement V8-6-4 engine until 1984.
The HT4100 was prone to failure of the intake manifold gasket due to scrubbing of the bi-metal interface, aluminum oil pump failure, cam bearing displacement, weak aluminum block castings and bolts pulling the aluminum threads from the block. It may not have been the most successful engine to sit under the hood of a Cadillac, but potential buyers were no more satisfied with the other two engines available at the time, the V8-6-4 and the Oldsmobile 5.7 L Diesel. Reliability issues soiled the reputation of the HT4100. As a result, the Oldsmobile V8 gas engines were a popular and straightforward conversion.  Despite problems with the engines, Cadillac still had annual sales in the United States above 300,000 as late as 1986.
In 1987, a unique, more powerful engine was introduced in the Cadillac Allanté based on the same architecture.  The Allanté 4.1 had a new, reinforced engine block that would later be used in the Cadillac 4.5, it used a different camshaft profile and roller lifters to provide for improved airflow, in addition to multiport fuel injection. This engine was rated at 170 hp (127 kW) at 4300 rpm and 235 lb⋅ft (319 N⋅m) of torque at 3200 rpm.  Other than the basic architecture, the only thing the Allanté 4.1 shared with the HT4100 was the displacement, something easily changed in the engine family by simply using different diameter cast-iron cylinder liners.
The 4.1 standard HT 4100 was superseded by improved larger-displacement engines such as the 4.5 and 4.9, and the HT4100 ceased production after the 1988 model year.


=== Applications ===
1982-1985 Cadillac Fleetwood Brougham
1982-1987 Cadillac DeVille
1982-1987 Cadillac Eldorado
1982-1987 Cadillac Seville
1985-1987 Cadillac Fleetwood
1987-1988 Cadillac Allante has the same 4.1 liter displacement, but the block was unique and significantly reinforced, with many significant differences, making it a different engine, more closely related to the 1988 4.5 liter Cadillac engine


== 4.5 ==

The Cadillac 4.5 Litre engine introduced for the 1988 model year was an improved and enlarged version of the HT4100. However, the 4.5 L engine was never classified as HT4500. Engineering advances allowed the company to begin increasing displacement and output again. A bored-out (to 92 mm (3.62 in)) 4.5 L (273 cu in) 4.5 version was rated 155 hp (116 kW) and featured throttle body fuel injection. There were various versions of this engine built from its introduction in 1988 to the end of production in 1992 including a high-output LW2 version with multi-port fuel injection which produced 200 hp (149 kW) and 270 lb⋅ft (366 N⋅m) for the Allanté. Outside of the Allanté, Cadillac introduced a port fuel-injected 4.5 L V8 engine in 1990 with 180 hp (134 kW) and 245 lb⋅ft (332 N⋅m) across their model line up.


=== Applications ===
This engine was used in the following vehicles: 

1988-1990 Cadillac DeVille
1988-1990 Cadillac Eldorado
1988-1990 Cadillac Fleetwood
1988-1990 Cadillac Seville
1989-1992 Cadillac Allanté


== L26 4.9 ==

A larger version of the 4.5, the L26 4.9, debuted in 1991 at 4.9 L with a square 92 mm (3.62 in) bore and stroke. Despite the fact that it had similar output to the Allanté's 4.5 L port fuel-injected V8, the 4.9 L engine represented a significant upgrade for the remainder of the Cadillac lineup. Horsepower output was up 20 hp (15 kW) from the previous 1990 4.5 L engine and torque was up by 30 lb⋅ft (41 N⋅m), to 200 hp (149 kW) and 275 lb⋅ft (373 N⋅m) respectively. Both the 4.9 and 4.5 port fuel-injected engines required premium fuel due to a 9.5:1 compression ratio. The 4.9 produces its maximum horsepower at 4100 rpm.
The 4.9 L was used throughout the Cadillac line and was last available in the 1995 DeVille. The 4.9 was replaced by the new 4.6-liter Cadillac Northstar engine.


=== Applications ===
The 4.9 L engine was used in the following Cadillacs:

1991-1992 Cadillac Fleetwood
1991-1993 Cadillac Eldorado
1991-1993 Cadillac Seville
1991-1995 Cadillac DeVille (base trim only in 1994 and 1995)
1991-1993 Cadillac Sixty Special

Flicker-free,Start,1,"Flicker-free is a term given to video displays, primarily cathode ray tubes, operating at a high refresh rate to reduce or eliminate the perception of screen flicker. For televisions, this involves operating at a 100 Hz or 120 Hz hertz field rate to eliminate flicker, compared to standard televisions that operate at 50 Hz (PAL, SÉCAM systems) or 60 Hz (NTSC), most simply done by displaying each field twice, rather than once. For computer displays, this is usually a refresh rate of 70–90 Hz, sometimes 100 Hz or higher. This should not be confused with motion interpolation, though they may be combined – see implementation, below.
Televisions operating at these frequencies are often labelled as being 100 or 120 Hz without using the words flicker-free in the description.


== Prevalence ==
The term is primarily used for CRTs, especially televisions in 50 Hz countries (PAL or SECAM) and computer monitors from the 1990s and early 2000s – the 50 Hz rate of PAL/SECAM video (compared with 60 Hz NTSC video) and the relatively large computer monitors close to the viewer's peripheral vision make flicker most noticeable on these devices.
Contrary to popular belief, modern LCD monitors are not flicker free, since most of them use pulse-width modulation (PWM) for brightness control. As the brightness setting is lowered, the flicker becomes more noticeable, since the period when the backlight is active in each PWM duty cycle shortens. The problem is much more pronounced on modern LED backlit monitors, because LED backlights reacts faster to changes in current.


== Implementation ==
The goal is to display images sufficiently frequently to exceed the human flicker fusion threshold, and hence create the impression of a constant (non-flickering) source.
In computer displays this consists of changing the frame rate of the produced signal in the video card (and in sync with this, the displayed image on the display). This is limited by the clock speed of the video adapter and frame rate required of the program – for a given pixel clock speed, higher refresh rates require lower resolution or color depth, and higher frame rates require that the program producing the video recalculate the screen more frequently. For these reasons, refresh rates above 90–100 Hz to reduce flicker are uncommon on computers – these rates are sufficient to eliminate flicker.
On television, this is more involved, as the source material has a fixed frame rate (and is also traditionally interlaced video, in which one-half of the scan lines of each frame are broadcast at a time). Most simply, the frame rate can be doubled by simply displaying the same broadcast image twice in rapid succession, as is done with movie projectors (which display each frame of 24 fps film two or more times) – either displaying each field twice or alternating fields.
Alternatively, this can involve motion interpolation, where rather than displaying the original fields twice, creates interpolated images between the original frames. This may be combined with deinterlacing, converting the image to progressive scan (attempting to create a full picture from the two half images).
Higher refresh rates, while they reduce flicker, may cause other problems. Simply redisplaying the fields may cause judder if not a full number multiplication of the frame rate (e.g. 24 fps × 2 = 48), particularly on fast moving images, as the image is displayed repeatedly in the same location, rather than moving smoothly. Conversely, interpolation (which avoids judder and may create more fluid motion than in the original video) can instead cause blurring, particularly visible on fast scrolling text. See Three-two pull down and motion interpolation for further discussion.

Pradhan_Mantri_Matsya_Sampada_Yojana,Start,1,"The Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) (http://pmmsy.dof.gov.in/) is an initiative launched by the Government of India to establish a comprehensive framework and reduce infrastructural gaps in the fisheries sector. The scheme was announced by the Finance Minister, Nirmala Sitharaman during her speech in the parliament of India while presenting the Union budget for 2019–20 on 5 July 2019. The government intends to place India in the first place in Fish production and processing by implementing Neeli Kranti (transl. Blue Revolution). This scheme is in line with governments aim to double the farmers' income by 2022–23.

The policy envisages to integrate all the fishermen with agricultural farmers and provide all the facilities available through various farmer welfare schemes to the fishermen. A new dedicated department of Fisheries was constituted in a newly carved out Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying to implement this and other policy initiatives of the government.


== Financial assistance ==
In the Union Budget for 2019–20, the Finance Minister announced ₹804.75 crore (equivalent to ₹947 crore or US$110 million in 2023) to incentivize and promote processing in the fisheries sector for the Financial year 2019–20 through the newly formed Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying. During the Budget speech, the finance minister asserted: ""fishing and fishermen communities are closely aligned with farming and are crucial to rural India."" The Economic Survey of India for the year 2018–19 had stressed on allied sectors and focused mainly on enhancing rural economy by strengthening Animal husbandry and Fisheries. Apart from this, the government had earlier set aside ₹7,552 crore (equivalent to ₹89 billion or US$1.1 billion in 2023) in the Fisheries and Aquaculture Infrastructure Development Fund (FIDF), which was intended to be utilized in creating both inland and overseas fishery infrastructure in the country. The government had set a target of 20 tonnes for fish production through the Blue Revolution by 2022–23.
While announcing the stimulus package in the backdrop of the economic slowdown caused by the recent COVID-19 pandemic in India, the Finance Minister announced ₹20,000 crore (equivalent to ₹240 billion or US$2.8 billion in 2023) outlay to enhance the inland fisheries through Matsya Sampada Yojana. Out of this ₹11,000 crore (equivalent to ₹130 billion or US$1.6 billion in 2023) shall be utilized in promoting inland, marine fisheries, and aquacare and the remaining ₹9,000 crore (equivalent to ₹110 billion or US$1.3 billion in 2023) shall be deployed for building fishery infrastructure like harbors and cold storage chains. The government has targeted at increasing fish production to 700 thousand tonnes and help increase India's export to 1 trillion. The financial aid is also intended to provide employment opportunities to 5.5 million people in the next five years.

This development software is primarily used by automotive and electronic control unit suppliers to analyze the data traffic in serial bus systems. The most relevant bus systems to CANalyzer are CAN, LIN, FlexRay, Ethernet and MOST, as well as CAN-based protocols such as J1939, CANopen, and ARINC 825.


== History ==
Vector first offered CANalyzer on the market in 1992, and has been continually updating it since then. Today it is a widely used analysis tool for CAN buses. Besides its primary field of application, which is in-vehicle electronic networking in the automotive industry, CANalyzer is also used in many other industries such as rail transportation, heavy-duty vehicles, special-purpose vehicles, avionics, and medical technology. New technologies based on IP architectures in the automotive industry  are supported by CANalyzer.
CANalyzer offers bus monitoring, stimulation, and analysis functions for message traffic and data content. It allows users to configure and expand its functionality using an integrated programming language. CANalyzer displays and evaluates data in both raw and symbolic formats, providing a versatile measurement setup.
Back in 1992, Vector had already developed the DBC data format, which has become the de facto standard in the automotive industry for exchanging CAN descriptions. Relevant standards are supported for other bus systems as well, such as FIBEX for FlexRay, LDF for LIN and EDS/DCF/XDD for CANopen.


== Versions ==
CANalyzer version 1.0 was released in 1992.  CANalyzer was previously available in three different variants: Professional (PRO), which includes CAPL programming ability, Expert (EXP) which includes panels, and Fundamental (FUN), with basic features. The Fundamental variant has been discontinued as of April 2023.

== Plot ==
Story revolves around the Editorial Office of International Life of the Czechoslovak Radio. It works under the leadership of Milan Weiner, a journalistic icon. Other journalistic icons include Věra Šťovíčková, Jiří Dienstbier, Luboš Dobrovský or Jan Petránek. Young Tomáš gets among them a bit by mistake as the work in the editorial office was the dream of his younger brother Pavel. Tomáš mainly cared about keeping both of them safe until now. Little does he know that the local editors are watched by State Security (StB). Recording which could change the fate of many appears drawing more interest from StB. Time is running out, tension is rising, action must be taken. Tomáš has to decide whether he becomes one of those who go down in history, or if he protects his underage brother who is his last family.

Water_Protection_Zone,Start,1,"A Water Protection Zone is a statutory regulation imposed under Schedule 11 to the Water Resources Act 1991. The power was subsequently subsumed into The Water Resources Act (Amendment) (England and Wales) Regulations 2009. The only example in the UK was applied to the River Dee in 1999 as The Water Protection Zone (River Dee Catchment) Designation Order 1999 which covers the whole of the River Dee catchment from the headwaters down to the final potable water abstraction point at Chester
The creation of this protection zone gave powers to the then Environment Agency (now Natural Resources Wales) to monitor and control the use and storage of any potentially polluting substance brought into the catchment for any industrial or commercial operation - a controlled activity as defined by the order. All such controlled activities require a permit to be issued and the conditions of the permit are determined by a risk analysis mathematical model involving the nature of the substance, its quantity and the distance from any vulnerable drinking water intake.
Applications for consent are required to complete a formal application
Following a serious degradation of the quality of the River Wye, there have been calls for a new water protection zone to be established for that river.

Anchor_channel,Start,1,"Anchor channels, invented by Anders Jordahl in 1913, are steel channels cast flush in reinforced concrete elements to allow the installation of channel bolts for the fastening of components.
Anchor channels consist of steel C-shaped channels and anchors (mostly headed studs) which are connected to the channel by welding or riveting/forging. The channels are supplied with foam filler to prevent concrete from leaking into the channel when the concrete is poured.
The system includes T-shaped bolts which are called T-bolts or channel bolts in the regulations. They are also called hammer head bolts, serrated bolts or hook-headed bolts based on their shape and function. The T-bolts are inserted into the anchor channel after the foam filler has been removed. The T-bolts can be moved along the channel length to allow for adjustment.  The adjustment of the T-bolt location is required to compensate for construction tolerances or for a change in use for a particular application.  The T-bolt is then tightened to the required torque to fasten a component.


== Types ==
Hot-rolled and cold-formed anchor channels are available depending on the manufacturing method of the open profiles.
To provide corrosion resistance, anchor channels & T-bolts can be provided in hot-dipped galvanized or stainless steel.
Anchor channels and T-bolts can be either smooth or serrated. Serrated channels and T-bolts can resist loads in the longitudinal direction of the channel by means of a mechanical interlock. This is particularly useful in the case of seismic and dynamic loads.


== History ==

Concrete and iron reinforced concrete construction at the beginning of the 20th century required new methods of attaching various components to reinforced concrete elements. For smaller loads, trapezoidal wooden battens with bent nails were cast-in. Larger loads could only be attached with special claws when steel girders were embedded in concrete. Another development was S-shaped steel beams into which hook bolts were hung. To enable fastening in reinforced concrete elements that is independent of cast-in steel girders, Anders Jordahl developed a tied back, C-shaped ""slotted rebar"" with T-shaped hook-headed bolts in 1913.  At the time, Anders Jordahl was a German representative for the Kahn System, a product of Albert Kahn and Julius Kahn's Truscon company.  The new system by Anders Jordahl was patented in several countries in the following years. Since 1925 the term ""anchor channel"" has been used and industrial production has been carried out. Further developments by the various manufacturers followed until now.


== Regulations ==
Anchor channels and channel bolts are qualified in Europe according to EAD 330008-XX-0601 and designed according to EN 1992-4. In the US, the system is qualified according to Acceptance Criteria AC232 and designed according to AC232 and ACI 318. The qualification is certified in Europe by a European Technical Assessment (ETA) and in the US by an Evaluation Service Report (ESR). These specifications also contain the product-specific parameters required for the design, which is determined in the course of the approval process. 
The regulations in Europe and the USA are almost identical. In countries that are following European regulations with regard to fastenings in concrete (e.g. Malaysia, Singapore, Australia) ETAs, and in countries that follow US-American regulations with regard to fastenings in concrete (e.g. Canada, Mexico, Indonesia, South Korea, Taiwan, New Zealand) ESRs are accepted and referenced.


== Applications ==
Anchor channels are used, for example, to fasten glass curtain wall panels, precast concrete parts, utility lines, brick facades, reinforced concrete facades, brackets, elevator guiding rails, canopies or other components, e.g. in plant construction. Curved channels are used in tunnel construction, e.g. in tubings, used for the fastening of media or overhead wire. Depending on the manufacturer's product range, suitable anchor channels can be used for a wide variety of construction applications with different requirements for load-bearing capacity, fire protection and corrosion protection.

Street_Child_(charity),Start,1,"Street Child of Sierra Leone (commonly referred to as Street Child or SCoSL) is a United Kingdom-based charity employing local people in Sierra Leone which was founded in 2008 by Tom Dannatt, a businessman in London. Its stated mission is to reduce the number of children living on the streets by reuniting them with their families and putting them in long-term education.


== Street children ==
ScoSL and their team of local staff have established day care centres providing food, counselling, clothing and medical care in order to encourage children to get off the street. These children are then reunited with their families who receive financial as well as managerial support from the charity so that they can set up small businesses and receive a steady income in order to be able to enrol, and keep, their child in school. In cooperation with a NGO in Sierra Leone called Help a Needy Child (HANCi-SL), Street Child has reunited over 1,000 street children with families and placed them into school. Reports by the charity have shown that 95% of the children in the program continue their education and stay off the street.


== Every Child in School (ECiS) ==
This programme was set up by ScoSL in response to the 2nd Millennium Development goal, achieving universal primary education by 2015.
Every Child in School (ECiS) provides teacher-training, services and material provisions to impoverished, outlying rural areas where children have had no previous access to education.
Through the ECiS programme, twelve school structures have been constructed in remote, rural communities around Sierra Leone providing education for around 2,000 children.


== Head count investigation ==
In 2011, SCoSL paired with StreetInvest, a British organisation, in cooperation with Sierra Leone's Ministry of Social Welfare, Gender and Children's Affairs, to conduct the first ever investigation into the actual number of children living in the streets of Sierra Leone.
The investigation was carried out by local volunteers with expert knowledge in the field who were able to identify and have access to key sites where street children could be found.

Open_access_(infrastructure),Start,1,"In the context of infrastructure, open access  involves physical infrastructure such as railways and physical telecommunications network plants being made available to clients other than owners, for a fee.
For example, private railways within a steel works are private and not available to outsiders. In the hypothetical case of the steelworks having a port or a railway to a distant mine, outsiders might want access to save having to incur a possibly large cost of building their own facility.


== Marconi and radio communication ==
The Marconi Company was a pioneer of long distance radio communication, which was particularly useful for ships at sea. Marconi was very protective about its costly infrastructure and refused—except for emergencies—to allow other radio companies to share its infrastructure. Even if the message sender was royalty, as in the Deutschland incident of 1902, they continued to refuse access. Since radio communication was so new, it preceded laws, regulations and licenses, which might otherwise impose conditions to open infrastructure to other players.


== Pilbara railways ==
In the Pilbara region of Western Australia, two large mining companies operate their own private railway networks to bring iron ore from mines to the port. In 1999 North Limited made an application to access Rio Tinto's system, but Rio's takeover of North Limited meant that application was never fully tested. In 2004 Fortescue Metals Group launched a bid to have the Mount Newman railway owned by BHP Billiton declared for third party access. The owner of the line claimed that they formed an integral part of the production process, and so should not be subject to completion requirements. When these mines started in the 1960s, state laws required the miners to make their infrastructure available to other players, but no application had been made. In the same region, the Fortescue Metals Group railway has been set up for open access for a fee.
In June 2008 the Federal Government advisory body, the National Competition Council, recommended that BHP Billiton's Goldsworthy railway and Rio Tinto's Hamersley & Robe River railway should be declared open access. Treasurer Wayne Swan was given 60 days to make a final decision based on this recommendation. On October 27 the three lines were declared with open access to apply from November 20, 2008. This will apply for 20 years under the National Access Regime within the Trade Practices Act 1974. The declaration does not give a right of access, but provides a third party with recourse if access terms cannot be negotiated with the infrastructure owner.


== Concerns ==
A player seeking access to infrastructure would expect to pay several fees of a capital and operating kind.  Hopefully, the cost of this is less than having to build separate infrastructure. It is in the public interest that access disputes be resolved in an efficient way, so that for example, profits are maximized and therefore income tax on those profits is also maximized.
The potential for monopoly infrastructure to charge high fees and provide poor service has long been recognized.  Monopolies are often inevitable because of high capital costs, with governments often imposing conditions, in exchange for approval of the project and for the granting of useful powers such as land resumption.  Thus a canal might have its rates regulated, and be forbidden to operate canal boats on its own waters.


== Trackage rights ==
Where there are many separate railways and one railway wishes to run trains off their own tracks onto the tracks of another, they may seek trackage rights from the other railway(s).  This can be done by voluntary agreement, or by compulsory order of a regulator.  In time of flood and accident which puts a line out of order, compulsory trackage rights may be ordered in the public interest to keep traffic flowing, assuming that alternative routes exist.


== Joint Venture ==
One of the problems faced by Open Access are fair prices.  Consider the Iron Ore minnow BC Iron which seeks access to the Fortescue railway.  (Fortescue has declared itself to be an open access operator).
BC Iron and Fortescue agreed to set up a joint venture to operate both the BCI mine and the railway connection to the port.  As the larger player, Fortescue will run the show.  The joint venture gives BC Iron inside information as to how much the railway and port will cost, while Fortescue gains inside information about the mine.


== Geraldton ==
In 2010, Mount Gibson Iron spent a total of 20 million dollars to upgrade the ore unloaded at Geraldton.  The facility will be open to other users who will pay a toll for such usage.
The Oakajee port and railway network is also to be open access.


== Queensland ==
In 2011, GVK has offered to make its proposed railway from the Galilee Basin to Abbot Point as open access to other players.


== Telecommunications ==
In the telecommunications industry, open access to existing infrastructure, in the form of local loop unbundling, duct sharing, utility pole sharing, and fiber unbundling, is one proposed solution to the middle mile problem.

Bristlebot,Start,1,"A bristlebot or brushbot is an extremely simple form of walking robot. It is one of the simplest of all mobile robots, both in its function and its construction. As a result of this ease of construction, they have become popular projects at the school science fair level.


== Operation ==

A bristlebot is a simple, rigid-bodied robot where the lower surface is coated in bristles, like a brush or velvet. The mass of bristles are oriented so that there is an overall inclination to them away from vertical. This is broadly consistent across the robot body, so that it gives a preferred ""forward"" direction. The robot is driven by vibrating its body. The action of these vibrations through the mass of bristles is to gradually move the robot, in the preferential direction of the bristles. There is some comparison between the vibration of a bristlebot and the lashing of bacterial flagella.
Most bristlebots are electrically driven, making use of modern developments in low-mass motors and batteries. As bristlebots have such crude locomotion, for both efficiency and control, they are not usually considered as appropriate for sophisticated control systems or responsive behaviours.


=== Vibrobots ===
A vibrobot is a related robot, but based on the use of springy wire legs, rather than brush bristles.
Vibrobots powered by clockwork or elastic motors have a long history, pre-dating the electric bristlebots. They have been a regular theme in the work of Brazilian designer Chico Bicalho.


== Construction ==
Construction of bristlebots became popular in the mid 2000s, as cellphone vibrate motors became available as a low-cost item, either from scrap pagers and cellphones, or directly from their Chinese factories. These form an ideal bristlebot power source as they are both powerful enough and also light enough, even with a battery. The typical home-constructed bristlebot consists of only three functional parts: a toothbrush head, a vibrate motor and a lithium coin cell. Glue, tape or tie-wraps are used to assemble the parts.
The toothbrush must be selected and possibly trimmed to give a flat contact surface with most bristles aligned in one direction. Worn toothbrushes are often no use, as their splayed bristles point in every direction. Such a bristlebot may then rotate or oscillate, but without travelling. Some new brushes may have very vertical bristles that do not generate much movement, unless trimmed into a slope.


=== Group construction ===
Group construction of bristlebots is a popular science project for children, through schools, Maker Faires and similar.
Kits are available to 'simplify' assembly and add decoration, although this is very far from necessary.


=== Developments ===
Artbots or drawbots may be constructed by adding pens to a bristlebot, or using a few suitable pens as the bristles themselves. Such robots are used on a large sheet of paper, where they leave behind a drawn trail. This trail indicates the efficiency of the bristlebot, its distance travelled from the start relative to the circuitous distance along its crooked path.
Recent toothbrush heads, such as the Oral-B Pulsar, include rubber blades as well as stiff bristles. These make an even better performing bristlebot that is faster in a straight line.
Domestic scrubbing brushes, with larger motors, may be used to make larger brushbots with equally simple construction.
By separating the drive across two brush heads, a bristlebot may begin to have steering control. Simple robotics with long-established circuitry may then be used to drive each side independently, with two motors. By controlling their relative power with regard to an external stimulus such as light, a robot with simple behaviours such as light-seeking or light avoidance, may be constructed.

This idea of creating a controllable, steerable BristleBot can be further extended by using a WiFi enabled micro controller to create a bristlebot that you can drive from a smartphone, or even teach to drive autonomously.

In BEAM robotics, a sophisticated bristlebot may begin to resemble a Walker, although these multi-legged robots are usually much more sophisticated, using multiple actuators with independent control.


== Commercial bristlebots ==
The popular Hexbug range of toy robots began with the Hexbug Nano, a bristlebot. Nano V2, a development of the original Nano released in 2013, has three additional flexible spines on their top surface. This gives them the new ability to climb vertically between two suitably spaced plates or tube walls. As the upper spines are only a narrow row, the 'bots are unstable when upside down and so become self-righting.
A variety of clear plastic tube habitats are offered with them. These range from a simple vertical tube to demonstrate climbing, through to multi 'bot habitats with multiple horizontal arenas linked by curved climbing tubes in clear plastic. A variety of additional construction set tube parts are available, including twisted tubes and funnels 
The game Electric Football uses players with bristled bases to move across a vibrating playing field.

Diary_(stationery),Start,1,"In stationery, a diary (UK and Commonwealth English), datebook, daybook, appointment book, planner or agenda (American English) is a small book contained a main diary section with a space for each day of the year with room for notes, a  calendar. Usually, various pages at the beginning and end contained various pieces of reference information, which may include maps and telephone codes, and pages for a short address book at the end.  Most diaries are pre-printed for a specific year on the cover. With each day's space, they were able to be printed with the day of the week. However, diaries that can be used for any year are also produced. Page-marker ribbons are commonly included. The US Customs official definition of a diary is: ""A book prepared for keeping a daily record, or having spaces with printed dates for daily memoranda and jottings; also applied to calendars containing daily memoranda on matters of importance to people generally, or to members of a particular profession, occupation, or pursuit"".
The main different sizes produced are the small pocket diary and larger desk diary, both of which come in many different sizes. Any size may be referred to as an appointment diary, especially larger diaries with pre-printed lines for each period in the day, as in the picture above.  A large variety of layout formats are sold, including:

page per day
week per view/opening
week per page
month per view/opening
Often, as in the diary pictured above, weekend days are given less space than workdays. Small calendars of the current month, and if there is room, previous and following months at the bottom of the page are also typical. 
Most diaries run from January to December, but school or academic diaries, also known as ""mid-year"" diaries, run for twelve months from shortly before the beginning of the school or academic year.  Many diaries are themed for different interest groups, and contain relevant reference information to that interest. Others are given as gifts by businesses. Especially in diaries for children or young people, many are now branded for fictional characters, authors, recording artists or magazines.  
The British stationery business now called the Letts Filofax Group Ltd produced the world's first pre-printed diary in 1812, calling it the ""Commercial Diary"".  Printed diaries now is competing with loose-leaf personal organizers and various electronic forms of diary functions on personal computers, personal digital assistants and mobile telephones.

. This may be translated into a statement about the maximum rate of a code with given length and minimum distance. The Gilbert–Varshamov bound for linear codes asserts the existence of q-ary linear codes for any relative minimum distance less than the given bound that simultaneously have high rate. The existence proof uses the probabilistic method, and thus is not constructive.
The Gilbert–Varshamov bound is the best known in terms of relative distance for codes over alphabets of size less than 49.  For larger alphabets, algebraic geometry codes sometimes achieve an asymptotically better rate vs. distance tradeoff than is given by the Gilbert–Varshamov bound.

The above result was proved by Edgar Gilbert for general code using the greedy method as here. For linear code, Rom Varshamov proved using the probabilistic method for the random linear code. This proof will be shown in the following part.
High-level proof:
To show the existence of the linear code that satisfies those constraints, the probabilistic method is used to construct the random linear code. Specifically the linear code is chosen randomly by choosing the random generator matrix 
  
    
      
        G
      
    
    {\displaystyle G}
  
 in which the element is chosen uniformly over the field 
  
    
      
        
          
            F
          
          
            q
          
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {F} _{q}^{n}}
  
. Also the Hamming distance of the linear code is equal to the minimum weight of the codeword. So to prove that the linear code generated by 
  
    
      
        G
      
    
    {\displaystyle G}
  
 has Hamming distance 
  
    
      
        d
      
    
    {\displaystyle d}
  
, we will show that for any 
  
    
      
        m
        ∈
        
          
            F
          
          
            q
          
          
            k
          
        
        ∖
        
          {
          0
          }
        
        ,
        wt
        ⁡
        (
        m
        G
        )
        ≥
        d
      
    
    {\displaystyle m\in \mathbb {F} _{q}^{k}\smallsetminus \left\{0\right\},\operatorname {wt} (mG)\geq d}
  
 . To prove that, we prove the opposite one; that is, the probability that the linear code generated by 
  
    
      
        G
      
    
    {\displaystyle G}
  
 has the Hamming distance less than 
  
    
      
        d
      
    
    {\displaystyle d}
  
 is exponentially small in 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
  
. Then by probabilistic method, there exists the linear code satisfying the theorem.
Formal proof:
By using the probabilistic method, to show that there exists a linear code that has a Hamming distance greater than 
  
    
      
        d
      
    
    {\displaystyle d}
  
, we will show that the probability that the random linear code having the distance less than 
  
    
      
        d
      
    
    {\displaystyle d}
  
 is exponentially small in 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
  
.
We know that the linear code is defined using the generator matrix. So we use the ""random generator matrix"" 
  
    
      
        G
      
    
    {\displaystyle G}
  
 as a mean to describe the randomness of the linear code. So a random generator matrix 
  
    
      
        G
      
    
    {\displaystyle G}
  
 of size 
  
    
      
        k
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle kn}
  
 contains 
  
    
      
        k
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle kn}
  
 elements which are chosen independently and uniformly over the field 
  
    
      
        
          
            F
          
          
            q
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {F} _{q}}
  
.
Recall that in a linear code, the distance equals the minimum weight of the non-zero codeword. Let 
  
    
      
        wt
        ⁡
        (
        y
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \operatorname {wt} (y)}
  
 be the weight of the codeword 
  
    
      
        y
      
    
    {\displaystyle y}
  
. So

The Varshamov construction above is not explicit; that is, it does not specify the deterministic method to construct the linear code that satisfies the Gilbert–Varshamov bound. A naive approach is to search over all generator matrices

 to check if the linear code associated to 
  
    
      
        G
      
    
    {\displaystyle G}
  
 achieves the predicted Hamming distance. This exhaustive search requires exponential runtime in the worst case.
There also exists a Las Vegas construction that takes a random linear code and checks if this code has good Hamming distance, but this construction also has an exponential runtime.
For sufficiently large non-prime q and for certain ranges of the variable δ, the Gilbert–Varshamov bound is surpassed by the Tsfasman–Vladut–Zink bound.

Business_Controls_Corporation,Start,1,"Business Controls Corporation is a privately held computer company
that developed an application-program-generator and also a series of accounting software packages. These packages were widely enough used for various business magazines to have back-of-the-book ads for companies seeking accountants with experience in one or more of them.
Computer magazines ran coverage for their SB-5 application-program-generator as from time to time new versions were released, each with new or improved features.


== Early days ==
The company's initial offerings were packages for the DEC PDP-8, although Business Controls Corporation also wrote custom-written programs for customers.
Large customers with mainframes who also used smaller systems for departmental use and distributed processing also used BCC's services.


== SB-5 ==
The addition of an application-program-generator named SB-5 that, from specifications, could generate COBOL code was a major step forward. Although this began with supporting the DEC PDP-11, they subsequently began to support COBOL on DEC's DECsystem-10 & DECSYSTEM-20. VAX support came later.
The specifications also permitted COBOL inserts and overrides: SB-5 could build an application that was all COBOL, yet only code the portions that varied from BCC's ""vanilla"" accounting packages.


=== Similar offerings ===
A similar idea was done for the IBM mainframe world in the form of a series of application-program-generators from Dylakor Corporation. They were named DYL-250, DYL-260, DYL-270 & DYL-280. Dylakor was acquired by Computer Associates.
The specific syntax was different, but it had wider use, and - a mark of success and recognition in the industry  - syntax-compatible implementations were released by a competitor.
Still another alternative was Peat Marwick Mitchell's PMM2170 application-program-generator package. Like the others, it supported COBOL inserts and overrides.


=== Extended integration ===
Business Controls Corporation subsequently extended SB-5's feature set to provide support for System 1022, a product for the DECsystem-10 & DECSYSTEM-20; 1022's vendor also had a VAX/VMS (later OpenVMS) product, System 1032.

A historical palace remains, built by Ahilyabai Holker of the Holker Family of King Pan Pohi.


== Geography ==
Its area was 1348 hectares. Pisore Khand is surrounded by hills to the east and north and open land to its west and south. Surrounding villages include Bhangaon to the west, Takali to the east; Khandgaon to the north and Devulgaon to the south.
The village contains seven ponds built by the government as part of the Rural Employment Plan enacted during the 1972 drought.


== Temples ==
Pisore Khand includes two ancient temples: the Kongjai temple on Kongjai Hill, situated to the north of the village; and Nawlai on the Hill of Nawlai, east of the village. Bhairavnath temple, Maruti temple, shiva Temple, Vitthal Rukhmini Temple in Village while  Khakibaba Darga situated at boundry of Pisore Khand at the bottom of Hill. 


== Demographics ==
At the time of the 2001 census, 426 families lived in the village, comprising a total population of 2207 (1124 males and 1083 females). The population of children aged zero to six was 292 (135 male and 155 female). Children aged zero to six make up 13.23% of the total population of the village.

The_dog_who_carries_his_master's_dinner_round_his_neck,Start,1,"The dog who carries his master’s dinner round his neck is one of La Fontaine's Fables (VIII/7) published in 1678. A story of relatively recent origin then, it was directed against city authorities who defrauded the public funds.


== The fable ==
The fable concerns a dog who has been taught to control its appetite when delivering its master’s dinner while he is at work. It defends its load when attacked by another dog but, when other dogs join the fight, proposes that they share in the spoil and seizes a large piece for itself. La Fontaine’s opening four lines muse on the difficulty humans have in restraining their instincts before he proceeds to an example of an animal who has been so trained and only breaks down when forced by circumstances. He then draws a parallel with the behaviour of those charged with administering public funds.
One French commentator has found a similar story in the Latin fable from Jacques Regnier’s Apologi Phaedrii ex Ludicris (Beaune, 1643), Coqui canis et alii canes (The cook’s dog and the other dogs), in which fidelity is overcome by bad example. However, La Fontaine’s immediate source seems to have been Louis de Puget (1629-1709), whom he got to know during a visit to Lyon. De Puget had versified the story in French as a criticism of the public authorities in his town and showed it to La Fontaine, who took it up and gave it a wider application.
There have been two oil paintings based on La Fontaine’s fable. His illustrator Jean-Baptiste Oudry gave the title to a 1751 depiction of a dog fight in the countryside; in the plate later used in the illustrated edition of the fables, other dogs can be seen racing along the path from the town in the distance. The other painting was made in 1846 by the Belgian dog painter Joseph Stevens (1819–92) and is now in the Hermitage Museum.

The_Wildbirds,Start,1,"The Wildbirds are a 5-piece rock band from Milwaukee, Wisconsin founded in 2007.


== History ==
The original line-up was formed by Nicholas Stuart, Matthew Reetz, Michael Ziemann, and Jon Jon Fries in 2006 in Appleton, Wisconsin. Each had previously been a part of the indie-rock band Number One Fan. Shortly after the recording of their debut album, Michael Ziemann left the band and was replaced by Hugh Masterson.
Their debut album Golden Daze, released on Universal Republic in 2007, was written in Matthew Reetz's hunting cabin in the Northwoods of Wisconsin. It was produced by Greg Fidelman (U2, Tom Petty, Johnny Cash) and engineered by Greg Gordon (Oasis, JET, Hot Hot Heat). The album was reviewed by David Fricke in the January 24, 2008 issue of Rolling Stone.
The Wildbirds spent only 6 months on tour before taking an undefined hiatus in early 2008. Stuart relocated to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and then to Portland, Oregon. Fries moved to Woodstock, Illinois, where he pursued other musical interests. Reetz settled back in Appleton, Wisconsin, with his wife, Emily. Masterson spent time traveling between New York, Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, and Wisconsin.
In February 2010, singer Nicholas Stuart announced The Wildbirds were once again active with an entirely new line-up. Stuart had reconnected with Masterson and moved to Milwaukee to begin writing music. The result, a 6-song EP entitled ""Sunshine Blues"", was released on July 22, 2010.
On January 26, 2012, an official Facebook post from the band read, ""We're writing, don't you worry!"" However, the Wildbirds released no further music.
On October 11, 2019, the Wildbirds reunited at The Cooperage in Milwaukee for the Flannel Fest Pre-Party.

Storer_Communications,Start,1,"Storer Broadcasting, Inc. was an American company which owned several television and radio stations in the Northeastern United States. It was incorporated in Ohio 1927, and was broken up in 1986.


== History ==


=== 1920s–1940s ===

In 1927, George B. Storer and brother-in-law J. Harold Ryan founded Fort Industry Oil Company to build service stations for Speedene brand gasoline in the Toledo, Ohio area. Speedene sales were booming, thanks to a cost-cutting device implemented by the partners. They bypassed the cost of trucking gasoline to service stations by building the stations beside railroad sidings and sold their product at two or three cents a gallon under the going retail rate by filling their tanks directly from railroad tank cars.
Storer decided to buy some radio spots on Toledo's radio station, WTAL, to advertise his gas stations. The spots were effective, and in 1928 Storer decided to use his wealth to buy a stake in the radio station as well. As part of the deal, WTAL changed its call letters to WSPD, ""Speedy AM,"" symbolic of the gasoline brand.
In 1931, Fort Industry sold its oil interests to concentrate solely on broadcasting. It bought full control of WSPD in 1937, and bought a number of other radio stations.


=== 1950s–1960s ===
Although the company had success in the Top 40 rock and roll format with WJBK in Detroit and WIBG ""Wibbage"" in Philadelphia, most of its radio stations, including WJW in Cleveland, WAGA in Atlanta and WSPD, featured more conservative music formats, typically middle-of-the-road (MOR), country music or beautiful music.
In 1948, Fort Industry entered the television market, launching WSPD-TV in Toledo. This was followed by WJBK-TV in Detroit later in 1948, and WAGA-TV in Atlanta in 1949. As television became more popular, Storer bought several television stations in other markets. The company changed its name to Storer Broadcasting later in the 1950s. A notable trademark of Storer stations were their studio facilities being built to resemble Southern antebellum mansions; while in most of Storer's markets (Toledo, Detroit, Boston, etc.) the architecture was somewhat out of place, it fit in perfectly in Atlanta and Birmingham. WJW, notably, did not get a facility in this design when a new studio complex was built for them in the mid-1970s, instead opting for a more modern approach, as did WITI in 1978. Almost all of the stations that had these facilities are still based in them in some fashion to this day.
The company focused primarily on the radio and television businesses through much of its history. However, it did venture into the cable television business in the early 1960s. It also purchased Northeast Airlines in 1965 and held it until 1972, when it was sold to Delta Air Lines.
George Storer was company president until his 1973 retirement, succeeded by his son Peter; George remained company chairman until his death in 1975. Due to his position as a director of CBS, he was able to obtain lucrative CBS network affiliations for Storer-owned television stations, such as WXEL (now WJW-TV) and WJBK-TV, which had been DuMont affiliates. By 1961 Storer was the nation's sixth-largest television broadcaster—exceeded in size only by the three networks (ABC, CBS, and NBC), Metropolitan Broadcasting (later Metromedia) and the Group W division of Westinghouse Electric.
The company purchased its first cable television system in 1963. It also briefly ventured into program syndication as Storer Programs Inc., during which it was the U.S. distributor of the original 1963–65 run of The Littlest Hobo, which was produced in Canada.


=== 1970s–1980s ===
During the 1970s the company focused on cable television. Storer sold the radio assets and the airline, using the cash thus raised to invest in cable television. Commencing in 1978, it embarked on an aggressive program of acquiring cable franchises. Unlike many cable operators, Storer preferred to acquire franchises and build its cable systems rather than acquire existing cable operations.
The company also ventured into sports. From 1973 to 1975 Storer owned the Boston Bruins and the Boston Garden.
The company's name was changed to Storer Communications, Inc. in 1983. By 1984 it owned and operated seven television stations and held franchises to provide cable television service to over 500 communities in 18 states and had some 4,800 employees. During that time, Storer co-produced nationally syndicated programs (such as Break The Bank & the 80s revival of Divorce Court) under a joint venture with Blair Entertainment, a distribution firm founded in 1975 as the second iteration of Rhodes Productions and was renamed to the moniker it held at the time in 1983 when it was acquired by John Blair and Company. Blair later shut down in 1992 and its library was bought by All American Television, a predecessor of Fremantle North America.
In 1985, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR) took Storer Communications private in a hostile leveraged buyout after Comcast began showing interest in Storer's cable properties. It sold the television assets in 1987. WTVG (the former WSPD-TV) was sold to a local ownership group, eventually becoming an ABC owned-and-operated (O&O) station in 1995 (it had been an NBC affiliate for all but five years of its history prior to its sale to ABC, with primary CBS affiliation from 1955-58 and primary ABC affiliation from 1958-69). The remaining former Storer television stations were sold to Gillett Communications in 1987 after an aborted 1986 attempt to sell them with Wometco's WTVJ in Miami to Lorimar-Telepictures. (WTVJ eventually became an NBC owned-and-operated station.) SCI Holdings (the holding company for Storer Communications, Inc) had placed up the cable unit, which was Storer Cable up for sale that year. Storer later revoked the no sale decision for the cable business, choosing to keep the Storer Cable division instead.
Gillett's broadcasting division was restructured into SCI Television in 1991, then sold to New World Communications in 1993, after a speculative bid from Scripps-Howard that never came to fruition, due to the number of stations that would have been potentially owned at the same time.
Fox Television Stations purchased the stations (except for WSBK and KNSD) in 1997.
Most of the stations switched to Fox affiliation, resulting in CBS scrambling to find affiliates in Atlanta, Cleveland, Detroit and Milwaukee, and eventually landing UHF stations in those cities. WSBK remained independent and was sold to Viacom, and eventually became a UPN affiliate. KNSD, which remained an NBC affiliate, was later sold directly to NBC to become an NBC owned-and-operated station. The cable assets were sold to Comcast Corporation and TCI in 1988. Michael Tallent became President of Storer, succeeding Kenneth Bagwell, upon the consummation of this transaction.
Storer Communications continued to operate as a cable television company until the assets were split between Comcast and TCI in the mid-1990s. Tallent joined Comcast in 1991 and was succeeded by William Whelan, Storer's final president.

Camerata Mediterranea devotes itself to research, dialogue, and pedagogy involving the diverse musical civilizations of the Mediterranean basin, Christian, Jewish, and Muslim. It aims to revive the value of forgotten interactions and intends to reestablish a dialogue, at once artistic, intellectual and human, among civilizations.


== Purpose ==
Camerata Mediterranea encourages research and communication among specialists and artists knowledgeable in the traditions of their respective civilizations.
In Europe, the old sources are written; in the East, the main source of transmission is oral. These different ways of conceiving and apprehending musical art create problems which the institute proposes to help overcome.
Camerata Mediterranea wishes to address these different traditions, largely separate today but sharing many common and ancient roots. Beyond the intrinsic interest and beauty of these musical languages, Camerata Mediterranea is of the opinion that the current historical moment calls forth new gestures of openness and of exchange.


== Music ==
Camerata Mediterranea is especially concerned with early and traditional musical repertoires of southern Europe, Spanish and Iberic, and also Arabic, Arabo-Andalusian, Jewish, Ottoman, and other related repertoires of the Mediterranean basin and the Middle East.
Joel Cohen, one of the foremost authorities in the research and performance of medieval and early music, will direct the institute's programs. Much of his recent work has involved the music of early Iberia and its three religions.


== History ==
As early as 1982, Joel and the Boston Camerata had developed a program called ""The Sacred Bridge,"" exploring Jewish and Christian interactions during the Middle Ages. In 1988 Erato Records decided to make a recording of this program. Still in demand after more than two decades, the recording has recently been reissued on Warner Classics.
The ""Sacred Bridge"" program continues to tour internationally; most recently (April 2007) in Worcester, Massachusetts and Paris, France. Since its inception it has undergone considerable development, and now includes an important Arabic/Muslim component. Recent performances have been undertaken with the U.S.-based Sharq Arabic Music Ensemble
In 1997 Joel Cohen met the eminent Moroccan musician, Mohammed Briouel, for the first time. Their encounter gave birth to a major production, a selection of the thirteenth century Cantigas de Santa Maria, attributed to King Alfonso el Sabio, with European and Moroccan musicians collaborating. The recording, made in Fez, Morocco, was signed ""Camerata Mediterranea,"" and included the participation of the Abdelkrim Rais orchestra of Fez, directed by Mr. Briouel.
The ""Cantigas"" recording won the coveted Edison Award in 2000, and has toured extensively in the United States, Morocco, Germany, the Netherlands, and France.
A Mediterranean Christmas, with the Boston Camerata and the Sharq Ensemble, is Joel Cohen's most recent production exploring shared roots and musical practices. Recorded in 2005 for Warner Classics, and enthusiastically greeted by the musical press, the production has also toured live in the United States and France.
In recent seasons Joel Cohen has also undertaken collaborations with Dünya, a Turkish music ensemble, and its leader, Mehmet Ali Sanlıkol. With Camerata Mediterranea and the Atrium of Chaville, he is planning a colloquium in early 2009 around the subject of cross-cultural Mediterranean musical interactions.


== Activities ==
Camerata Mediterranea is prepared to function as an international production unit.
Activities to be organized may include:

Colloquia, usually a week to several weeks, reuniting recognized scholar- specialists and professional musicians.
On-campus workshops and seminars coordinated to university/high school curricula.
Teaching semesters or mini-semesters.
Language and poetry study sessions.
Scholarships for proven professionals to study firsthand outside their field.
Camerata Mediterranea's first international colloquium was held in the French village of Saint-Guilhem-le-Désert, on June 26 and 27, 2009, and included participants from France, Spain, the United States, Turkey, Israel, and Morocco. Current plans,  in collaboration with the municipality of Saint-Guilhem,  are to make this colloquium a biennial event.

Grand_Magal_of_Touba,Start,1,"The Grand Magal of Touba is the annual religious pilgrimage of the Senegalese Mouride Brotherhood, one of the four Islamic Sufi orders of Senegal. On the 18th of Safar, the second month of the Islamic calendar, pilgrims gather in the holy Mouride city of Touba to celebrate the life and teachings of Amadou Bamba, the founder of the brotherhood.
The Grand Magal has been recognized as ""one of the most popular pilgrimages in the world,"" with over 3 million participating in 2011. The pilgrimage dates back to 1928 (one year after Bamba's death) and commemorates his 1895 exile to Gabon by the French colonial government.


== Etymology and history ==
""Magal"" is a Wolof word derived from the verb ""mag,"" which means ""to be important"" or ""to be old""; the noun form is translated as ""celebration"" or ""anniversary."" There are other Mouride magals annually, such as the Magal of Saint Louis, which commemorates a prayer performed by the saint in 1895 in defiance of colonial authorities. However, the Grand Magal is the most important and widely attended of the Mouride magals. It is the largest celebration in Senegal, both religious and secular.
The Grand Magal originates in a request of Amadou Bamba's in which he asked that his followers celebrate the anniversary of his exile to Gabon. However, after Bamba's death in 1927, his son and successor Moustapha Mbacke organized the first Mouride gathering on the anniversary of his death rather than his exile (the first of these early Magals occurred in 1928, with an estimated participation of 70,000). This date remained until 1946, when Serigne Moustapha Mbacke's successor, Falilou Mbacke, changed the date of the Magal to the anniversary of Bamba's exile, in accordance with Bamba's original wishes. The period of exile in Gabon holds great importance to Mourides: it is seen as a time of persecution and testing of Bamba's spiritual strength and resolve.
The Grand Magal has grown over the years, from hundreds of thousands of pilgrims attending in the later decades of the twentieth century to nearly 2 million in 2000 and over 3 million in 2011. The event is televised, with coverage in part serving the Mouride Brotherhood's proselytizing mission; video cassettes of the Magal are sold domestically and internationally as well.


== Dates of the Grand Magal the touba ==
The date of the Grand Magal is determined by the Islamic calendar (known as the Hijri calendar), which is based on the lunar year. Each year, the events of the pilgrimage begin on the 18th of Safar and last for two days. Because the Islamic calendar is lunar and the Islamic year is about eleven days shorter than the Gregorian year, the date for the Grand Magal changes from year to year. Thus, each year in the Gregorian calendar, the pilgrimage starts eleven days (sometimes ten days) earlier than the preceding year. This makes it possible for the pilgrimage season to fall twice in one Gregorian year, and it does so every 33 years, most recently in 2013. The table below shows the Gregorian dates of the Grand Magal of recent years:


== Rites and rituals ==
The Grand Magal is at once a ceremony and a festival, containing both religious rituals and entertainment. ""No other event in Senegal, religious or secular, attracts as much attention"", writes Villalón; it is ""anticipated for weeks and generates a general effervescence."" The rites of the pilgrimage bear similarities to those of the Islamic Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca: the two central events of the Magal are visits to the Great Mosque of Touba, which involves a partial circumambulation of the mosque, and to the mausoleum of Amadou Bamba, which is believed to be infused with the barakah, or spiritual power, of Bamba. Pilgrims pray with outstretched hands and touch the walls and doors of the mausoleum, and some drop coins inside the area around the tomb, which is fenced off. They may wait for over six hours for a few minutes of prayer at these locations.
Pilgrims also visit the mausoleums of other important Mouride leaders, many of whose tombs are located near the mosque. Other common sites to visit include the ""Well of Mercy,"" said to have been created by God to flow for Cheikh Amadou Bamba, and the central library of Touba, which contains the many writings of the Cheikh and other influential Mourides. Lastly, pilgrims visit their personal Mouride spiritual guides, or marabouts. Each prominent Mouride marabout has a residence in the city from which he accepts visits. During the night, pilgrims gather to sing Arabic poetry (or qaṣāʾid) written by Bamba.
There is also a political dimension to the Grand Magal, in which the most prominent Mouride leaders - including the head of the Brotherhood, or Caliph General (currently Serigne Sidy Mokhtar Mbacké) – grant audiences to official government delegations and others of political importance. The tradition has roots in the colonial period, when it was created to defuse tension and demonstrate mutual recognition between the powerful Mourides and the French colonial government.
Informally, pilgrims also visit Touba's renowned marketplace, one of the biggest in the country. Because of the minimal government presence in the city (due to its religious character), business is conducted with little state regulation or oversight; a wide range of products can thus be found with prices lower than those of any other market in Senegal.


== Logistics and facilities ==
The large number of pilgrims in Touba during the Grand Magal demands an intense degree of organization and logistical management. Traffic jams and road accidents are common as heavy crowds descend on Touba each year; during the November 2016 Magal, 16 people were killed and 572 injured while travelling to the pilgrimage, according to the lieutenant-colonel of the National Fire Brigade.
In Touba, workers must act with a high degree of discipline, solidarity, and single-mindedness. The Mouride Baye Fall sect are the principle drivers of this effort and provide much of the logistical manpower. Additionally, different local associations of Mourides (called da'iras) are responsible for maintaining different pilgrimage sites and residents of Touba house and feed the pilgrims. The Senegalese government also provides some technical support, although this is generally kept to a minimum due to the religious nature of the event and site. In 2014, 1300 policemen and 160 healthcare workers were deployed to Touba during the Magal, and the army gave out bread rolls and coffee.
Preparations for the pilgrimage begin officially on 1 Safar each year, seventeen days prior to the pilgrimage, and are led by the Committee of Organization of the Grand Magal of Touba.
Special health measures were planned for the October 2020 pilgrimage because of the COVID-19 pandemic in Senegal.


== International presence ==
By the late 1970s, significant numbers of Mourides were living abroad; this presence has only grown with the intensifying globalization of the past decades. Community associations of disciples, known as dahiras (a Wolof term derived from the Arabic word for ""circle""), have arisen in many international cities with robust Mouride communities: in 2011, researchers found 47 cities across western Europe and 16 cities in North America with active Mouride dahiras. According to Ross, ""Murid dahiras abroad are intended as both extensions of, and conduits to, the holy city itself"" and they organize celebrations of the Grand Magal annually.
In these gatherings, the singing of sacred Mouride poetry and watching of televised footage from Touba is especially important, as these practices connect expatriate Mourides to their spiritual brethren in Touba. With the organizational support of the dahiras, the Grand Magal and can now be accurately characterized as a truly global phenomenon.

Merv_Griffin_Enterprises,Start,1,"Merv Griffin Enterprises was an American television production company founded by Merv Griffin, in operation from March 7, 1963, to June 4, 1994.


== History ==
The company was first established as Milbarn Productions on March 7, 1963, and later as Merv Griffin Productions on March 5, 1964. Griffin's first production under the Milbarn name was Word for Word. Griffin's second game show was Jeopardy! as Griffin's first production under the MGP name on March 30, 1964. In May 1965, his talk show The Merv Griffin Show returned to television. Griffin also created the game show Shopper's Bazaar, which changed its name to Wheel of Fortune on January 6, 1975, after Jeopardy! was canceled on January 3, 1975. Griffin revived Jeopardy! as The All-New Jeopardy! on October 2, 1978, though it was proven to be unsuccessful. Merv Griffin Productions also owned the post-production studio Trans-American Video (TAV) that was founded on June 29, 1981.
In 1982, the company joined forces with King World (now CBS Media Ventures) to syndicate a nightly version of Wheel of Fortune. The company also had the rights to syndicate The Merv Griffin Show. KW also distributed the first two pilots of Jeopardy! in 1983 and January 9, 1984. In 1984, Griffin expanded his company as Merv Griffin Enterprises and during the same year, Jeopardy! also returned to television on September 10. On May 5, 1986, Griffin sold the company to The Coca-Cola Company (then-owner of Columbia Pictures Industries) for $250 million during his semi-retirement. TAV, however, was not included in the deal. The company later became part of Columbia Pictures Entertainment on December 21, 1987, and was sold to Sony Corporation along with CPE's other companies on November 8, 1989.
Merv Griffin Enterprises was folded into Columbia TriStar Television (now Sony Pictures Television) on June 4, 1994. Jeopardy! and Wheel of Fortune were taken over by CTT starting in September of that year, while Griffin remained executive producer for both game shows until 2000. Griffin later founded Merv Griffin Entertainment on May 13, 1996.


== Employees ==
One of the most prolific employees was Don Pardo. The others were Charlie O'Donnell, Jack Clark, John Harlan, M. G. Kelly, and Johnny Gilbert, who were also announcers on Griffin shows. Most of the above announcers also worked for Bob Stewart Productions. Future executive producer of Jeopardy!, Michael Davies, worked as a development associate at the company during the early 1990s. Another employee was director Dick Carson, who also served as director for The Tonight Show for his brother Johnny Carson.

Vikara,Start,1,"Vikāra (Sanskrit:विकार) basically means – change, change of form, change of mind, disease. It is one of the ten categories of causation listed by Vasubandhu in his Madhyānta-Vibhāga-Bhāśya. In the Sanskrit texts, it is used in the Prātiśākhyas that introduce phonic substitutions by mentioning the substituted unit in the nominative ending and the substitute in the accusative ending.
According to the Sadvidyā (the science of being) of Uddālaka Āruni, dualistically all things that exist are differentiations, vikāras (transformations) of sat, the primordial being, who is the universal substrate; all things can be identified on account of nāmarūpa (distinct name and form). Purusha (Brahman) created all these multi-folds of Nature by transforming himself. This is the same as the Samkhya theory of causation, Satkaryavada, which is based on the premise that the effect is existent in the cause, and the original cause is Prakṛti composed of three  gunas which are tendencies and modes of operation. Prakrti is closely associated with the concept of Maya within Vedic scripture. The world is seen to be ever-evolving because vikāra (modification) is its svabhāva (nature); origination and dissolution are two vikāras, and causal efficiency is the power to initiate change. A change (vikāra) can take place only when there is action. Vivartavada of Advaita Vedanta involves apparent vikāra or modification, a mere illusion.
In Ayurveda, diseases produced by one dosha are known as nanatmaja-vikāra, those produced by more than one dosha are known as samanyaja-vikāra; these are not vyādhi-rogas but distinct and treatable disorders. Kāma (lust), Krodha (anger), Lobha (greed), Moha (deep emotional attachment, stupidity), Mātsarya (envy) and Madā (pride, wantonness) are the vikāras of the mind mentioned in the Bhagavad Gita.

John_S._Blenkiron,Start,1,"John Scantlebury Blenkiron is a fictional character who appears in several books by John Buchan, including Greenmantle, Mr Standfast, The Courts of the Morning and  Sick Heart River. Blenkiron comes from the United States, and has assisted Richard Hannay. When Hannay first meets Blenkiron, it is revealed that he suffers from dyspepsia and so often drinks boiled milk, eats dry toast and fish. Subsequently he has an operation where a part of his duodenum is replaced by rubber tubing and his digestion is restored.
Blenkiron often professes his wish to join the war or ""be let into a scene of real bloodshed"", but he confesses that he ""has never seen anything gorier than a presidential election."" Blenkiron also does not seem short on money and is used to living the high life. As a consequence, when he travels through Europe as an English spy, he becomes quite comfortable living with successful German politicians and Generals. Blenkiron is a strong believer in the Christian faith and quite often comments on his faith. He often remarks that he is a ""Neutral"" as that he comes from the United States and is quite proud of the fact. In ""Greenmantle"", on meeting (Major, at that time) Richard Hannay, he pronounces the word as ""Nootral"", a dramatic device giving the reader a nice literary clue as to his origin in the USA and dialect. in ""Mr Standfast"" he also states ""I considered that the time had come to pay for valuable ""Noos"" "".


== Appearance ==
Blenkiron, as described by the author, is a ""big fellow with a fat, sallow clean shaven face."" He also has ""a pair of full sleepy eyes"". Christopher Hitchens calls him ""a fat and rich but nonetheless brave and humorous figure"".
In the last chapter of Mr Standfast (the third Hannay Novel by Buchan) Blenkiron achieves his desire to participate in ""a real high-class Armageddon"". Hannay has him inspanned as a battalion-commander in British uniform, leading the actions of a scratch American Engineer-company and other emergency troops put together in a hurry. Blenkiron and his companies successfully stem at a vital time, the strong German advance towards Amiens, and so he prevents the loss of newly-dug trench lines - a loss which would mean disaster for the whole front.


== Evaluation ==
According to Charles Moore, Blenkiron's presence in Greenmantle is due to the book being written with the purpose of getting the United States to join the Allies in World War I. This happened in 1917, the year after the book's publication.
H. E. Taylor notes that Buchan portrays Blenkiron positively as a businessman. He suggests that Buchan ""may have felt more comfortable delineating a positive business character as a foreign national who, by reason of his absurd pastiche accent and diction, could not in any case aspire to gentrification.""

Rohrbrunn,Start,1,"Rohrbrunn (Hungarian: Nádkút) is a village in Burgenland, Austria. It is part of the municipality of Deutsch Kaltenbrunn in the district of Jennersdorf. Rohrbrunn is located near the border of Styria by the river Lafnitz.


== History ==
Rohrbrunn was part of the Kingdom of Hungary until the Treaty of Trianon in 1920. It belonged to Vas county. The small village has been inhabited by ethnic Germans since its establishment in the Middle Ages. According to the Roman Catholic ecclesiastic administration Rohrbrunn always belonged to the nearby parish of Deutsch Kaltenbrunn.
""Nádkuth"" was given to Ferenc Batthyány in 1524. The ownership of the noble Batthyány family lasted about 350 years. In 1605 the army of Stephen Bocskay destroyed almost the whole village.
In 1851 Elek Fényes recorded that Rohrbrunn was populated by 428 people (almost exclusively Roman Catholic Germans). There was a toll-house in the village due to its proximity to the border of Styria. The Batthyánys remained the main landowners. The peasants earned their livelihood from growing wheat, tobacco, hemp and fruits or making a small amount of wine.[1]
Alois Brunner, one of the most infamous Austrian Nazi war criminals, was born in Nádkút in 1912. In World War I a total of 31 men perished.


== Name ==
In 18th and 19th century sources both the traditional German and Hungarian names of the village are mentioned. Rohrbrunn and Nádkút have the same meaning: ""reed-well"" which refers to the marshes of the Lafnitz valley. The German name was recorded in 1427 as Rohrprunn. [2] The Hungarian name was recorded as Nádkuth in 1524. The German version became the sole official name of the village after 1920.

Equal_Local,Start,1,"Equal Local were an Australian synth-pop band, formed in Melbourne, Victoria in 1980. The original line-up was Dean Richards on guitar, Philip Jackson on synthesisers, trumpet and rhythm generator, Melissa Webb on synthesisers and piano, Bryce Perrin on double bass, and Mick Hauser on saxophone. Richards and Jackson were ex-members of electronic post-punk group Whirlywirld.


== History ==
Equal Local formed in early 1980 and quickly attracted a cult following within Melbourne's Crystal Ballroom scene, appearing on bills alongside fellow synth-pop acts Essendon Airport and Tsk Tsk Tsk, and garnering acclaim from critics such as Clinton Walker, who called them ""the best, most important band to emerge in Melbourne since The Birthday Party left for England."" Equal Local created avant-garde instrumental music that combined a post-punk edge with elements of cocktail music, jazz, funk and calypso, among other genres. Using a computer designed and built for the band by member Robin Whittle, they were also pioneers in the use of programmable beat sequencing software during live performance, predating the release of Fairlight CMI's ""Page R"" by a couple of years.
When The Birthday Party returned to Melbourne in early 1980 to record their album Prayers on Fire with producer Tony Cohen, Jackson, Hauser and Ewart were invited by the band to contribute horns to two songs: the LP's first single ""Nick the Stripper"", and ""Zoo Music Girl"". Also in 1980, Equal Local provided the soundtrack for the documentary Punkline, filmed in the Crystal Ballroom.
Two songs by Equal Local, ""Widespread"" and ""Barren and Wasted"", appeared on the fifth edition of the cassette magazine Fast Forward, released in 1981. That year, Equal Local released the EP Madagascar on Missing Link Records, and in 1982, Powderworks Records released their song ""12 Ways to Go"" as a single. The band toured interstate before disbanding in 1982. That year, a recording of their last ever show, held at the Crystal Ballroom on 29 May 1982, was released as a live album by the cassette label Rash (DECISIONS).

Tarquinian_conspiracy,Start,1,"The Tarquinian conspiracy was a conspiracy amongst a number of senators and leading men of ancient Rome in 509 BC to reinstate the monarchy, and to put Lucius Tarquinius Superbus back on the throne.  The conspirators were discovered and executed.  The story is part of Rome's early semi-legendary history.


== Background ==
In 509 BC the Roman monarchy was overthrown as a result of general resentment at the behaviour of the king Tarquinius Superbus, and especially his son Sextus Tarquinius who had raped Lucretia, a Roman woman of noble background.  A coup, led by Lucius Junius Brutus, resulted in the expulsion of the royal family.  The Roman Republic was established, and consuls were elected to govern the city on an annual basis.


== Conspiracy formed, but discovered ==
Brutus was elected as one of Rome's first two consuls in 509 BC.  In that year ambassadors from the royal family arrived in Rome to seek to persuade the senate to return to the royals their personal effects which had been seized during the coup.  In secret, while the Roman senate debated the request, the ambassadors sought supporters of the monarchy in Rome to form a conspiracy to re-admit the royal family to the city.  Two brothers of Brutus' wife, of the Vitellii, both of whom were senators, were chief amongst the conspiracy, along with three brothers of the Aquilii, and other leading men whose names are no longer recorded.  Two of Brutus' sons, Titus Junius Brutus and Tiberius Junius Brutus joined them.
However, a slave of the Vitelii, having witnessed a meeting of the conspirators at his master's house (which Plutarch claims involved a horrific oath by human sacrifice and cannibalism), alerted the consuls who immediately seized the ambassadors and the conspirators without great tumult.


== Punishment ==
The ambassadors of the royal family had persuaded the conspirators to confirm their dedication to the royalist cause in writing, and therefore the guilt of the conspirators was not in doubt.
The ambassadors were released, out of respect for the law of nations. However the traitors were condemned to death, including the sons of Brutus.
The consuls sat upon the tribunal to witness the execution.  The lictors were dispatched to carry out the punishment.  The traitors were stripped naked, beaten with rods, and then beheaded.  Brutus the consul is said to have burst forth with emotion at times during the punishment of his sons, although elsewhere he is said to have watched stoically while the punishment was carried out.
The slave who had revealed the conspiracy was granted his freedom and status as a Roman citizen, and was also awarded a sum of money as reward.

Oppenheim_family,Start,1,"The Oppenheim family is a German Jewish banking family which founded what was Europe's biggest private bank, Sal. Oppenheim. According to Manager Magazin 2008, the Oppenheim family was among the 30 richest families in Germany, with assets over 8 billion Euros.


== History of the family and raising to nobility ==
Salomon Oppenheim founded the banking firm Sal. Oppenheim in the late 18th century. Until its sale in 2009, Sal. Oppenheim was the largest privately owned investment/banking house in Europe, with assets of €348 billion.
The Oppenheim family also co-founded the German Colonia-Versicherung and sold their majority stake for 3 billion DM in 1989. 820 million DM were used to increase the equity of the bank, while the rest (over 2 billion DM) was paid out to the family.
In 1867, the family received nobility in Austria with the title of Baron and a year later, in 1868 they were admitted to nobility of Prussia, also with the title of Freiherr.

Issue_network,Start,1,"Issue networks are an alliance of various interest groups and individuals who unite in order to promote a common cause or agenda in a way that influences government policy. Issue networks can be either domestic or international in scope depending on their collective goal. With the rise of the internet, many interest groups have turned to online resources, such as blogs and social media, to promote and spread their cause because of its low cost and high efficiency in outreach. An issue network's tactics vary depending on their goals and purpose. In developed countries, issue networks often push for a change in policy within the government bureaucracy. An example includes the wide-ranging network of environmental groups and individuals who push for more environmental regulation in government policy. Other issue networks may revolve around such controversial issues as abortion, gun ownership rights, and drug laws. In the most extreme circumstances, issue networks may seek to achieve their means through violence, such as terrorist organizations looking to overthrow existing governments altogether. In the U.S, the most common tactic of effective issue networks is the role they play in what is called Iron Triangles. This is the three-way back-and-forth communication process between Congress, Bureaucracies, and the interest groups that make up an issue network where they discuss policy and agendas in order to compromise on solutions to satisfy each other's agendas.


== Types of issue networks ==
In this table, subjects are categorized from high to low complexity and salience. Salience, meaning how high something affects a large number of people, and complexity meaning how much training and knowledge is needed for someone to answer the questions that can be asked about the subject. The typography below is by William T. Gormley


== Iron triangles versus issue networks ==
Issue networks may be confused with the related concept of Iron triangles, but have several key differences. One of these is that issue networks are generally free-forming groups of people in the public sector who form a coalition together, not through a congressional committee, or a federal agency but are bound together to work on a current issue. Therefore, issue networks are often temporary, breaking up when their goals are accomplished, unlike iron triangles. Another difference between iron triangles and issue networks is that issue networks can oppose each other. For instance, an issue network based around supporting the construction of a pipeline can cause another issue network to form that opposes it. The members of an issue network may support or oppose it for various reasons, but what brings them together is their shared opinions.


== Other countries ==
From a stable policy community, through a period of substantial change under firm government control, to a densely populated and competitive environment composed of issue networks. In countries such as Australia and the United Kingdom, government is returning to a more interactive strategy regarding issue networks. In other countries, group input is a vital component of the policy-making process, through that process bureaucratic expertise is built-up and maintained. The existence of knowledgeable government agencies is necessary to balance the demands of competing groups and thereby ensure greater stability of policy outcomes. For example, in Australia, higher education is a good example of how the government is listening to clientele groups (issue networks) less than they were in the past due to the complexity of universities and the higher education system.

The_Players_Association,Start,1,"The Players Association was a New York based studio group, put together by drummer/arranger Chris Hills and producer Danny Weiss in 1977 on Vanguard Records.


== Overview ==
The Players Association recordings brought in leading jazz session musicians such as Joe Farrell, David Sanborn, James Mtume, Bob Berg, Mike Mandel, synthesist Marcus Barone, and Lorraine Moore on vocals as well as  others. Whilst writing some of their own songs, the group mainly focused on covers. Their two biggest hits were ""Disco Inferno,"" a cover of the Trammps tune, and their own composition ""Turn the Music Up!""  Both tracks were recorded on the Vanguard label and issued in the UK as 12-inch singles which boosted the group's popularity on the dance floors around the UK.
""Disco Inferno"" was an underground club hit in the United States and the United Kingdom, most notable for the piercing solos from trumpeter Jon Faddis, Michael Brecker and David Sanborn on tenor and alto sax. The band proved more popular in the United Kingdom, where they scored three chart singles including the disco hit ""Turn the Music Up!"" (entered UK chart at number 41 on 4 March 1979), which reached number 8 in the UK Singles Chart and ran for nine weeks, and one chart album, which also prompted a British tour. Their other minor hit chart singles were, ""Ride the Groove"" (released in the UK in 1979) which reached number 42 in the UK chart and ""We Got the Groove"" (released in the UK in 1980) which peaked at number 61. After the release of five albums between 1977 and 1981, the association ended.

Karnataka_Motor_Sports_Club,Start,1,"Karnataka Motor Sports Club, popularly known as KMSC, is a state association for promoting and conducting motorsports in the Indian state of Karnataka. The club is based in Bengaluru. It is a founder member of the Federation of Motor Sports Club of India (FMSCI), the governing body for motor sports in India. It is one of the oldest ‘active’ motorsports clubs in India. It holds the record of organising the Karnataka 1000 rally (K1000 rally) continuously for the last 48 years (except for two years).
KMSC was started by a group of petrol heads, under the stewardship of Fred Webb, in 1954 under the initial name, Bangalore Motor Sports Club (BMSC). After a meeting with like-minded people including Cyril Doveton and John Webb (Fred's son) in the same year, the club was started and Fred Webb became its first president. Both Webb and Junior Webb took great interest in the club motorsports activities and conducted regular drag races at Yelahanka and Jakkur air strips. They also took part in other parts of the country, specially Sholavaram. Then the club played a great role in starting the Federation, FMSCI and later changed its nomen clature from Bangalore Motor Sports Club to KMSC. Over the years, the Karnataka 1000 rally, which was started in 1975, became one of the flagship events of the club. It is one of the oldest rallies conducted regularly in the world. It had a break for a couple of years due to reasons beyond the club's control. Other similar clubs in Karnataka are Chikmagalur Motor Sports Club, Motorsports Association Of Vijayanagar, and Motorsports Inc which have also conducted National championship rounds.


== K1000 rally ==
The Karnataka 1000 Rally, an annual rally run on Time, Speed, Distance (TSD) format over two to three days, was started in 1975. In the early years, the K1000 ran over 1000 miles covering dirt tracks of three states, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. Over the years it became a popular destination for the top motorsports rally drivers in the country. In 1988, it joined the National calendar as it was included as a round in the Indian National Rally Championship (INRC). In 1996, the rally shifted to European Special Stage format in line with all other INRC rounds under the aegis of FMSCI.
The first rally run in 1975 over 1850 km of mixed roads including gravel, kutcha, tarmac, was won by a Bangalore team Sivaram, D. Vinod Sivappa, Feroze Asgar Ali and Shivprasad, Bangalore in an ambassador. Those days, there used to be four drivers as the route is long with night driving. For the last few years, the rally is being held on the dirt tracks, near Gubbi in Tumakuru district. The 2022 K1000 rally was won by Karna Kadur and co-driver Nikhil Pai. It was Kadur's maiden K1000 title. The 47th edition will be held in Tumakuru from 21 to 23 December 2023.[1]


== Office-bearers ==
Currently, KMSC is headed by Gautam Shantappa, who is also the vice-president of FMSCI, with Bhaskar Gupta as vice-president. The office-bearers of the club were elected on 12 November 2020. Former K1000 champion in his class, Sanjeev Shah, is elected as the new general secretary. BS Prakash became the Joint Secretary while MD Sathyavratha is the Treasurer. Former secretary, Praneet Perumal, Janardan Babu and Shanmuga are the members of the managing committee. Advocate VS Harish is co-opted as legal adviser.
In the earlier years, BMSC's AD Jayaram was the FMSCI president in the year 1974–75. Other FMSCI presidents from KMSC include Ravi Gupta in 1980–81, Shramik Masturlal from 1996 to 99.and R Bharat Raj in 2014–15. Goutham Shanthappa is the vice-president for 2022–24. Earlier, Shivu Shivappa, the then president of KMSC served as vice-president for a term of two years from 2018.

Mode_scrambler,Start,1,"In telecommunications, a mode scrambler or mode mixer is a device for inducing mode coupling in an optical fiber, or a device that, itself, exhibits a uniform output intensity profile independent of the input mode volume or modal excitation condition. Mode scramblers are used to provide a modal distribution that is independent of the optical source for purposes of laboratory, manufacturing, or field measurements or tests. Mode scramblers are primarily used to improve reproducibility of multimode fiber bandwidth measurements.


== Overview ==
If multimode fiber bandwidth is measured using a laser diode directly coupled to its input, the resulting measurement can vary by as much as an order of magnitude. This measurement variability is due to the combination of differences in laser output characteristics (emitted mode power distribution) and the differential mode delay of the fiber. Differential mode delay is the difference in the time delays amongst the fiber's propagating modes caused by imperfections or nonideality of the fiber refractive index profile.
The primary purpose of a mode scrambler is to create a uniform, overfilled launch condition that can be easily reproduced on multiple measurement systems, so that measurement systems have essentially the same launch conditions and can measure approximately the same bandwidth despite having different laser sources. These were used for this purpose in the first U.S. NIST round-robins on multimode fiber. The overfilled launch (OFL) was created to reduce measurement variability, and improve concatenation estimates for multimode fibers, used at that time for telecom 'long haul' (e.g., 7–10 km 850 nm or 20–30 km 1300 nm) systems.
When the telecom industry converted to near-exclusive use of single-mode fiber ca. 1984, multimode fiber was re-purposed for use in LANs, such as Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI), then under development.  The output modal power distribution of a mode scrambler is similar to the surface-emitters used in those first LAN transmitters, but this was fortuitous coincidence.  On average, but not in every case, the OFL bandwidth measured using a mode scrambler is lower than that produced by excitation of a partial mode volume (restricted mode launch or RML), such as occurs with directly coupled laser diodes.


== Types ==
There are two common types of mode scramblers: the ""Step-Graded-Step"" (S-G-S) and the ""step index with bends"". The S-G-S mode scrambler is actually an assembly, a fusion-spliced concatenation of a step-index profile, a graded-index profile and another step-index profile fiber. Typically, each segment is approximately 1 meter long, and may use segments of unconventional size to produce the distribution required according to core size of fiber to be tested.  Unconventional fiber size was not an issue, as they were developed by fiber manufacturers, but some test equipment has difficulty complying with revised qualification standards, and now use ""Step Index with Bends"" mode scramblers, which can be adjusted to purpose. Step Index with Bend mode scramblers are created simply by routing a specially designed step-index multimode fiber through a series of small radius bends, or by compressing fiber against surfaces with specific roughness.  The implementations are simple, but generally less reproducible, and require care to avoid over-stressing the fiber.
A mode scrambler can be characterized and qualified by measuring its near-field and far-field distributions, as well as by measuring one of these distributions while restricting the other. Guidelines for constructing a mode scrambler and qualifying its output can be found in the ANSI/TIA/EIA-455-54 fiber optic test procedure (FOTP).

October_2020_Ituri_offensive,Start,1,"On October 24, 2020, militants from CODECO-ALC attacked Congolese and MONUSCO forces in the town of Dele, Ituri Province, Democratic Republic of the Congo. In response, Congolese forces launched an offensive against CODECO-ALC, capturing several towns from the group and killing its leader Mountain Wolf.


== Background ==
In 2020, CODECO had begun peace talks with the Congolese government and MONUSCO into laying down their arms in Ituri Province. These talks culminated in a ceasefire in August 2020 by CODECO. The first faction of CODECO to sign the peace agreement was CODECO - Alliance for the Liberation of the Congo (CODECO-ALC), headquartered in Walendu Tatsi and Ezekere, near Bunia. CODECO-ALC was led by Justin Maki Gesi, known as Mountain Wolf. 
A few months after signing the agreement, CODECO-ALC broke off from the ceasefire agreement, and began preparing for attacks in and around Bunia. The first incursion was by 200 fighters into Bunia, demanding the release of inmates from the prison. CODECO-ALC then began a campaign against the Congolese government and MONUSCO around the city.


== Offensive ==
On October 24, 2020, MONUSCO peacekeepers patrolling the town of Dele, outside of Bunia, caught CODECO-ALC militants burning down civilian houses in the town. A firefight broke out between the two groups, and the peacekeepers managed to dislodge CODECO-ALC from the town, and called for backup. That same day, clashes broke out between CODECO-ALC and Congolese soldiers in the towns of Kijogo and Fichama. Congolese soldiers repelled CODECO-ALC in these attacks, but residents reported that at least two Congolese soldiers were wounded in the attacks.
Congolese forces then went on the offensive against CODECO-ALC in the Blue Mountains over the following days. Heavy fighting occurred in Ezekere, and Congolese soldiers pushed CODECO-ALC out of Djokodjo, Kambutso, and Mbetshi as well. At least thirty-three militants were killed in the offensive, and two to four Congolese troops were killed. On October 26, Congolese soldiers pushed CODECO-ALC out of Walendu Tatsi. In the Congolese offensive, Mountain Wolf was killed.
On November 3, CODECO-ALC launched an attack on Ezekere that killed five Congolese soldiers. However, Congolese forces retained control of the base that was attacked, and continued operations against CODECO in the area.

Piano_Six,Start,1,"Piano Six :the new generation is a collective of six Canadian pianists. Adopting the model of the original Piano Six founded by Janina Fialkowska and managed for ten years by Jane Colwell this new organization launched in 2018 includes pianists Marika Bournaki, David Jalbert, Angela Park, Ian Parker, Anastasia Rizikov and Daniel Vnukowski.
Between the months of April and November each year, one pianist performs in a regional tour within a two-week time span. Each pianist's visit includes a recital and one or more outreach events. The outreach events can be in the form of a concert for schools, a public masterclass or a special workshop for music teachers.


== History ==


=== Founding and early history ===
Piano Six was founded in 1994 by the Polish-Canadian pianist Janina Fialkowska. The other members of Piano Six were Angela Cheng, Marc-André Hamelin, Angela Hewitt, André Laplante, and Jon Kimura Parker.

Wharton_Follies,Start,1,"Wharton Follies is a student organization in the MBA program at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania that puts on an annual amateur musical theater production. Started in 1977, it is both one of the largest clubs and highest profile organizations at Wharton, staging one of the largest productions of its kind at any professional school. Over the years, Follies has been transformed into a Broadway-level production boasting a six-figure budget and with successive producers and directors building on their predecessor's accomplishments. Follies typically features prominent members of the administration (e.g., dean, vice dean, and admissions director), popular faculty members, and classmates. The show typically makes fun of the Wharton experience, other business schools, and students who have made a name for themselves. One student said that part of the appeal of Follies is that it “show[s] off student talent that you wouldn't otherwise be able to witness.”


== Follies Videos ==
In addition to a live stage show featuring the school's most talented students, Follies writes, shoots, and edits its own Saturday Night Live-style video features for public consumption. The videos treat typical business school topics in a humorous fashion. Recent topics have included ""The Evolution of an MBA,"" ""Drunken Case History,"" ""MBAs Assemble a Malm Bed,"" ""Jawn of the Dead,"" and ""Professors Read Mean Reviews.""

Theft_of_services,Start,1,"Theft of services is the legal term for a crime which is committed when a person obtains valuable services — as opposed to goods — by deception, force, threat or other unlawful means, i.e., without lawfully compensating the provider for these services.  It may also overlap with some types of fraud in which payment is made on credit, but under an assumed identity, and ultimately disavowed (""identity theft"").


== Types ==
Crimes of this sort are typically prosecuted as larceny, and may be either a misdemeanor or a felony, based upon the value of the services illegally obtained. This category encompasses a wide variety of criminal activity including tampering with (or bypassing) a utility meter so that the true level of consumption is understated, leaving a hotel or restaurant or similar establishment without paying for the service and ""turnstile jumping"" or other methods of evading the payment of a fare or fee when using a public transit vehicle or entering a private facility normally requiring payment (e.g., jumping over the fence at a fair or concert). Theft of services also occurs in the taxi industry, when a passenger in a taxi flees from the taxi to avoid paying the fee.  Another common form is using another entity's dumpster without their permission, as this creates an expense to the party paying for the service.  
Theft of this sort should not be confused with reasonable rejection, where, for example, a customer does not pay because the services provided were not as advertised or because the services did not meet reasonable standards of quality. For example, if a roofer installs a new roof, but the roof leaks, the customer might be able to withhold payment until the leak has been fixed. Withholding of payment without reason would be considered larceny.
These statutes have also, on occasion, been applied in the realm of health care, when hospitals or other health care providers have pressed criminal charges against indigent, uninsured patients who were unable to pay for their treatment. This scenario has prompted intense criticism, and is a key issue in the call for a major overhaul of the health care system in the United States.

Ensoniq_TS-10,Start,1,"The Ensoniq TS-10 was a synthesizer and music workstation introduced by Ensoniq in 1993. It provided synthesis, user sample playback, sequencer, effect units and performance facilities in a 61-key package.
Another version, the TS-12, had the same features plus 76 weighted keys and channel aftertouch courtesy of a Fatar keybed, whereas the TS-10 had polyphonic aftertouch and 61 unweighted keys.


== Main features ==
The TS series had 32-note polyphony, integrated 24-bit effects engine, (with 48 bit accumulation) a 30,000 note sequencer (expandable to over 100,000 via memory chips) which featured up to 24 tracks, full MIDI capabilities. The design was a direct evolution of Ensoniq's previous VFX and SD synthesizers. While the synthesis structure lacked a resonant filter, which limited the sample+synthesis possibilities, the TS could read ASR wavesamples directly. This feature allowed musicians to play sounds from a vast library of sample disks and CD-ROMs (via SCSI expansion option).
The front panel offered plenty of buttons for dedicated functions, and a large 40 x 92 vacuum fluorescent display, easier to read onstage than conventional LCD displays.


=== Synthesis structure ===
The TS offered up to 6 oscillators per patch or sound. Each oscillator was processed by its own pitch, filter and amplifier blocks, with dedicated LFOs and envelope generators for each block. The architecture allowed various modulation sources, such as keyboard velocity, modulation and pitch wheels, etc. to modify several instances of the sonic chain. Despite the well-specified architecture, the filter didn't feature any kind of resonance. This limited the possibilities of emulating analog and heavily-filtered sounds. However, this was a common omission from several manufacturers of the early 1990s. The total 32-note polyphony was reduced when using more than one waveform per patch. The user patches could be stored in one of 120 memories, or saved to floppy disk.


=== Hyperwave ===
It was an attempt to offer a kind of basic wavesequencing, it essentially was a series of user-defined waveforms, taken from the internal ROM or sample RAM area, and played in sequence with definable playback step times, pitch and other parameters. Clever use of this facility could produce complete rhythmic patterns. One big limitation was the wavesequencing timing, which was fixed at patch level and not tempo-dependent.


=== Effects ===
An integral component of Ensoniq synths, the TS' effects were first-class and well specified, at 24-bit and 32 kHz engine. The effects block was arranged in several fixed algorithms, which allowed up to three simultaneous effects at once, plus a dry signal path. The effects list was comprehensive, including reverbs, flangers, chorus, compressors, delays. While adequate at single patch level, the effects block had to be shared by all instruments when the sequencer was used, meaning that only selected sounds could ported their effects to the mix.


=== Sequencer ===
Ensoniq's approach for sequencing was somewhat different from other manufacturers. Instead of offering a linear set of tracks for recording, the TS required the user to record short sequences (12 tracks each) to use as a base for song structure, then chaining them and optionally layering another 12 linear tracks on top of the chained blocks. The sequencer editing options included quantization with audition, controller editing and scaling and MIDI functions per track, as well as copying whole or parts of tracks to anywhere else. The keyboard could store up to 30 songs with 100 sequences per song,  memory-permitting, and everything was kept in memory when the synth was turned off. Modern synthesizers, with larger and better sequencers, demand the user to save their work before power down, since the sequencer memory is not backed up.


=== Sample playback ===
In addition to the machine's internal 6 MB ROM sampled waveforms, the user could install up to 8 MB (divided into two banks of 4 MB) sample RAM (volatile), via 30-pin SIMMs. The samples could be loaded from the floppy disk drive, or via a SCSI hard drive or CD-ROM attached to the machine, containing an ASR-format disk. The synth even remembered the mapping of samples and sounds used, and requested the appropriate disks for loading in power-up. The TS couldn't import WAV or AIFF format samples as the disk format used was Ensoniq's own, first developed for the EPS sampler, and it wasn't MS-DOS compatible, so the user was limited to loading samples available in the extensive EPS/ASR library.


=== Performance features ===
The TS offered the ubiquitous pair of modulation and pitch wheels, polyphonic aftertouch, and 'patch select' buttons for easily changing tonal variants of a patch. It was very easy to layer up to three single sounds, or split the keyboard in all zones for internal or MIDI playing control, without cumbersome menu editing. It was also possible to layer up to six single sounds by taking advantage of the live-auditioning feature of the sequencer (without actually recording or playing back anything), but this was less easy to manage in a performance environment.


== In use ==
The TS suffered from limitations including the non-resonant digital filter, or the proprietary format used for floppies, which was incompatible with anything else. This prevented Standard MIDI Files to be read by the machine, and the strange track arrangement of the sequencer limited the MIDI multitimbral parts of the TS to 12 instead of the standard 16.
The vacuum fluorescent display, although unique and very easy to read, was prone to malfunction after much time of use and very hard to replace or repair. Even Ensoniq acknowledged this problem by creating a variant called the TS-10 Plus, which used a conventional LCD display instead of the vacuum one. This model also had the SCSI expansion installed and the full sample memory expansion also installed.
The TS series were well received by musicians and producers, mainly because of the rich, professional sound they offered, the enormous ASR sample library that it could load, and the live performance features that offered.

Two_Mile_Square_Reservation,Start,1,"The Two Mile Square Reservation or Two Mile Square Reserve was a tract of land in Ohio ceded by Native Americans to the United States of America in the Treaty of Greenville in 1795.  It was subsequently surveyed in a manner different from surrounding land, and lots sold to settlers.


== History ==
The Americans won the Battle of Fallen Timbers in 1794, ending the Northwest Indian War.  As a result of the battle, the Treaty of Greenville was signed, which ceded much of southern and eastern Ohio to America.  In addition, Article 3 ceded a number of other tracts, including #11: ""One piece two miles square, at the lower rapids of the Sandusky river.""  The lower rapids  is today in Fremont, Ohio, and the reservation is on land that would have otherwise been part of townships four and five north, range fifteen east of the Congress Lands North and East of First Principal Meridian.41°20′33″N 83°06′40″W
During the War of 1812, Fort Stephenson was built within the reservation, and successfully defended by George Croghan against attack by British and Indian troops under General Proctor.


== Survey and Sales ==

Congress arranged for a special indiscriminate location survey for the reserve. Under the Act of 1805, William Ewing subdivided it into four sections of a mile square in 1807, with neither township or range.  These were numbered one to four, with one in the northeast corner, and counting anti-clockwise. By Act of April 27, 1816, Joseph Wampler resurveyed the exterior lines, laid out 310 in-lots and 63 out-lots in the portion of section one east of the river for the town of Croghanville, set off two ""Public Reserves"" of one quarter section each, divided a river island in section one in two, and divided the remainder of the reserve into 22 ""Fractional Sections"" fronting the river of about 80 acres (320,000 m2) each. The reserve was assigned to the Canton Land District, with sales at the office in Wooster, for minimum prices assigned by the 1816 act. In 1829, the town was incorporated as Lower Sandusky, and the name was changed to Fremont in 1848.

GMT900,Start,1,"The GMT900 is a General Motors full-size pickup and SUV platform used from the 2007 to 2014 model years. The platform was introduced at the 2006 North American International Auto Show, as the replacement for the GMT800 platform. The first GMT900 vehicle introduced was the next-generation Chevrolet Tahoe.
GMT900 had been called a ""Hail Mary pass"" for the General Motors Corporation — the company needed the revenue from these large trucks to ensure their financial solvency. The company's resources were focused exclusively on GMT900 development through 2005, delaying other programs like the GM Zeta platform. With the 2005 spike in gasoline prices, some analysts have questioned the wisdom of ""betting the company"" on a line of large trucks. Sales were initially brisk, but later dropped off as the market moved to more fuel-efficient unibody vehicles.
The GMT900 series features standard vehicle stability control. Original plans called for American Axle's ""I-Ride"" independent suspension module in the rear, but was never used.
Tahoe production began at GM's Arlington Assembly plant in Arlington, Texas on December 1, 2005, six weeks ahead of schedule. Production of the SWB versions began at Janesville Assembly in Janesville, Wisconsin in early January 2006. Production of long wheelbase trucks (Suburban/Yukon XL) begins in Janesville and at Silao Assembly in Silao, Guanajuato, in March. The Avalanche will be produced only in Silao, and Escalade production began in March 2006, with the ESV being produced in Arlington and the EXT being produced in Silao.
The SUVs began to show up at dealers in January 2006. Sales initially exceeded expectations, but by 2008, General Motors announced they were significantly cutting back production. GM has closed the SUV plant in Janesville, Wisconsin, consolidating SUV production in Arlington, Texas.
The related Silverado and Sierra pickups started production in late 2006. The Hummer H2 was meant to move to the new platform in the next few years, but has since been cancelled (although the engines and gauge cluster shape has been carried over).
Due to a long-lasting downturn in sales of full-size trucks and SUVs in the United States (up to a 30% down through the first nine months of 2008), General Motors cancelled the next-generation CXX truck program in May 2008. Along with it, the replacements for the Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban and their siblings at GMC and Cadillac.
The automotive press has speculated that some GMT900 SUV models may move to the GM Lambda platform.
On January 14, 2010, General Motors announced that they will resume development of full-size trucks and SUVs.

Motor_babbling,Start,1,"Motor babbling is a process of repeatedly performing a random motor command for a short duration. It is similar to the vocal babbling of infants, where the brain learns the relation between vocal muscle activities and the resulting sounds. However, it was found that the general motor-control system is already exploring itself in the womb, in animals, in a similar way. Originally, the random spasms and convulsions of the embryo were seen as the non-functional consequences of growth. Later it was realized that the motor system is already calibrating its sensorimotor system before birth. After birth, motor babbling in primates continues in the random grasping movements towards visual targets, training the hand–eye coordination system. These insights are used since the early nineteen nineties in models of biological movement control and in robotics. In robotics, it is a system of robot learning whereby a robotic system can autonomously develop an internal model of its self-body and its environment. Early work is by Kuperstein (1991) using a robot randomly positioning a stick in its workspace, while being observed by two cameras, using a neural network (multilayer perceptron) to associate poses of the stick with joint angles of the arm. This type of research has led to the research field of developmental robotics.
The random exploration of the motor-control state and its effects can lead to the identification of parameters for a inverse kinematics and inverse dynamics model, which the robot can use to find appropriate control signals, given a particular task that requires positioning and/or force control.

Callout,Start,1,"In publishing, a callout or call-out is a short string of text connected by a line, arrow, or similar graphic to a feature of an illustration or technical drawing, and giving information about that feature. The term is also used to describe a short piece of text set in larger type than the rest of the page and intended to attract attention.
In documents that need to be translated often a neutral callout is used. By using numbers or letters as callout in combination with an image caption, translation is more efficient since the same graphic can be used in all languages.
A similar device in word processing is a special text box with or without a small ""tail"" that can be pointed to different locations on a document.
In the utility industry, a callout is an instruction to report for emergency or special work at an unusual time or place.

Gasogene,Start,1,"The gasogene (or gazogene or seltzogene) is a late Victorian device for producing carbonated water. It consists of two linked glass globes: the lower contained water or other drink to be made sparkling, the upper a mixture of tartaric acid and sodium bicarbonate that reacts to produce carbon dioxide.  The produced gas pushes the liquid in the lower container up a tube and out of the device. The globes are surrounded by a wicker or wire protective mesh, as they have a tendency to explode.
The earliest occurrence of the word noted in the Oxford English Dictionary dates from 1853, quoting a reference in  Practical Mechanic's Journal on ""Gaillard and Dubois' 'Gazogene' or Aerated Water apparatus"".


== In popular culture ==
A gasogene is mentioned as a residential fixture at 221B Baker Street in Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes story ""A Scandal in Bohemia"": ""With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner."" One is also mentioned in ""The Adventure of the Mazarin Stone"". The device plays a key role in Bernard Shaw's 1905 comic play Passion, Poison, and Petrifaction, Or The Fatal Gazogene.
The word is also used in Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child's novel Brimstone, published in 2005, on page 106, and in their 2010 novel Fever Dream on page 362, and in their 2013 novel ""White Fire.""
A gasogene is mentioned, on page 13, as being in the forensic laboratory of Dr. Kingsley, consultant forensic examiner of Scotland Yard in Alex Grecian's 2012 novel The Yard.
A gasogene is mentioned and its use described in Sherry Thomas's novel A Study in Scarlet Women (Book 1 of the Lady Sherlock series) on pages 244 to 246. (Ebook ISBN 9780698196353)

Davey_Moore_vs._Roberto_Durán,Start,1,"Davey Moore vs. Roberto Durán was a professional boxing match contested on 
June 16, 1983, for the WBA super welterweight title.


== Background ==
In January 1983, former welterweight champions Roberto Durán and Pipino Cuevas met in a non-title bout at the LA Sports Arena. Durán dominated the fight and scored a fourth-round knockout victory that put him in line for a title shot against the undefeated reigning WBA super welterweight champion Davey Moore. Despite Durán's impressive victory, he was still perceived to be on the downside of his career having lost to little-known Kirkland Laing only nine months prior and the 23-year old Moore expressed doubt that the soon-to-be 32-year old Durán would be a match for him, infamously stating ""Was that Duran looking so good or Cuevas so bad?""
The fight was originally scheduled to take place on May 27 in Bophuthatswana, South Africa with a Ray Mancini–Kenny Bogner WBA lightweight title fight as the co-main event, but the event was cancelled after Mancini was forced to pull out with a fractured collarbone. Two weeks later, the Moore–Durán fight was rescheduled for June 16 (Durán's 33rd birthday) at Madison Square Garden in Moore's native New York City. Durán underwent a rigorous training schedule with his longtime trainer Ray Arcel proclaiming ""Right now, he looks better than I've seen him in several years"" while Durán himself stated ""What will beat Moore is not only my experience, but my conditioning. If I had to pick between them, I would say my conditioning."" Durán admitted that a loss to Moore would possibly lead to his retirement saying ""If I lose, I'll probably retire, but I'm not thinking about losing the fight. I'm stronger, more mature, more experienced and I'm training more seriously than at any time in my career.""
Moore had successfully defended his title three times, defeating all three opponents by knockout and was installed as 5–2 favorite by oddsmakers and was confident in his ability to defeat his opponent claiming that Durán  ""over the hill but he still has his name and beating him will take me to the big money fights. I don't expect a very long fight, it might even be over in a round.""


== The fight ==
Durán started the fight aggressively and controlled most of the fight from there on. At the end of the first round Durán threw a jab that Moore attempted to dodge, but the thumb of Durán's glove instead inadvertently poked Moore in his right eye, injuring it immediately and hindering Moore throughout the rest of the fight. Durán continued to be the aggressor in the second round and bloodied Moore's nose with a straight right. Durán slowed his attack during the third and fourth rounds allowing Moore to become the aggressor but Durán still boxed affectively and Moore's right eye was almost entirely shut and he was now also bleeding from his lip by the end of the fourth. Finally, after dominating Moore over six+ rounds, Durán sent Moore down to the canvas with 15 seconds left in the seventh round. Clearly hurt, Moore was able to get up at the count of eight and was saved by the bell, though he was so dazed he went to Durán's corner rather than his own and had to be directed by the referee to get to his own. To start the eighth Moore tried to clinch Durán, but Durán was able to free himself and continued to punish Moore's head and body. After two minutes of Durán landing punches at will and with Moore offering little offensively or defensively and his face bloodied and both eyes almost shut, Moore's trainer Leon Washington threw a blood-soaked white towel in the ring to signify surrender, but referee Ernesto Magaña did not acknowledge it causing a Top Rank executive Jay Edison to enter the ring leading to the fight being stopped and Durán was named the winner by technical knockout.

Manqué,Start,1,"A manqué (feminine manquée, from the French for ""missed"") is a person who has failed to live up to a specific expectation or ambition. It is usually used in combination with a profession: for example, a career civil servant with political prowess who nonetheless never attained political office might be described as a ""politician manqué"". It can also be used relative to a specific role model; a second-rate method actor might be referred to as a ""Marlon Brando manqué"".


== Overview ==
The term derives from the past participle of the French verb manquer (to miss, to fail, to lack). In English, it is used postpositively, that is, following the noun it modifies in the manner of most adjectives in French.
The British political writer and former M.P. David Marquand described the mid-20th century Labour politician Aneurin Bevan as a ""statesman manqué"", while the magazine Private Eye referred to journalist Janet Street-Porter as an ""architect manquée"".
The Collins Dictionary gave the example of a manager as an ""actor manqué"", while the Oxford Dictionary of Foreign Words and Phrases cited the Times magazine in 1996 as describing a ""subway genius"" as ""a writer manqué since many of his chosen citations deal with creating literature"". Arising from the inscription on Plato's door in Ancient Greece, ""let no one devoid of geometry enter here"", the 17th-century philosopher Thomas Hobbes has been described as typifying a ""mathematician manqué"".
In Vladimir Nabokov's Lolita, the narrator, Humbert Humbert, reminisces, ""At first, I planned to take a degree in psychiatry as many manqué talents do; but I was even more manqué than that . . . and I switched to English literature.""


== As failure ==
In French manqué is sometimes applied to someone who has failed to gain professional status - such as un médecin manqué (a failed doctor) - whereas, in English, it need not have that pejorative implication. In the game of roulette the set of numbers from 1 to 18 is described as manque (no accent), meaning that the ball has ""failed"" to land in one of the higher (19–36) slots.


== Manky ==
The slang manky, meaning ""inferior"" or ""dirty"", is thought to be linked in some way to manqué, possibly from the Scots word mank (maimed or defective) but maybe via Polari. The ancestor of all these words is the Latin mancus (maimed or crippled; and, by transference, imperfect or incomplete).

Glintshake,Start,1,"Glintshake (Russian: ГШ) is a Russian rock band formed in Moscow in 2012, consisting of the vocalist and guitarist Ekaterina Shilonosova, the guitarist Yevgeni Gorbunov, the bass guitarist Yegor Sargsyan and the drummer Alexey Yevlanov.


== History ==


=== 2012–2014 ===
The founders of the band, Shilonosova and Gorbunov, met in Kazan. In 2011, Shilonosova moved to Moscow, where the band was formed the next year. Glintshake's first EP, Freaky Man, was recorded by Shilonosova and Gorbunov and published to the web in June 2012. In October, a music video was released for the title track, ""Freaky Man"", starring the artist Alexander Krivoshapkin. 
The first gig took place in Kazan on 17 November 2012. In March 2013, Glintshake released their second EP, Evil, after which they were invited to several major festivals in Moscow: Bosco Fresh Fest, Afisha Picnic and Faces & Laces. In August 2013, the band opened for The Smashing Pumpkins at Stadium Live in Moscow. In autumn 2013, Midborn left Glintshake and was replaced by Yegor Sargsyan from the band Trud. At the beginning of 2014, drummer Nikitin was replaced by Alexey Yevlanov from The Twiggys.
In May 2014, the band released its first album, Eyebones.

Rock quartet Glintshake started with a few simple and fast songs in the spirit of the nineties slacking alternative – on the new album the band played harder and more inventive, because of what it's natural to compare them with Sonic Youth and My Bloody Valentine. Glintshake promise to make a ""magic and hypnosis session"", and thanks to their new songs it sounds very believable. The current Glintshake is not going to spare the listeners – they sound noisy, violent, but at the same time very beautiful.
In May 2014, Glintshake released a video for the song ""Wiuwiuwiu"", which was filmed on an iPhone and edited in a single day. In November, the Nano Banana EP was released, recorded in a new studio near Moscow owned by the Xuman Records label. According to Gorbunov, the EP was ""free in terms of style"", due to the band moving away from its 1990s music influence. At the end of 2014, Glintshake recorded the song ""New Year of Hate"" for Afisha's New Year's project.


=== 2015–present ===
Early in 2015, Glintshake re-recorded the song ""Mu"" from the Nano Banana EP in Russian. According to Shilonosova, the original English text had little overlap with the Russian lyrics, but its meaning and general atmosphere were not changed. The re-recorded version of ""Мu"" and  ""New Year of Hate"" were released on the deluxe version of Nano Banana in June. In September, a music video for the song ""Wrong Anthem"" was released, created by the illustrator Alexander Kostenko.
At the same time, the band announced that ""good old Glintshake is coming to an end, but new and evil one is starting off"". In an interview with the website Furfur, Gorbunov said that the band had decided to withdraw from 1990s alternative rock influence, stop singing in English and make a full turn in work: ""…We've got a whole bunch of our own stuff: Zvuki Mu, russian avant-garde."" In October, Glintshake released a single from an upcoming album, the song ""Без пятнадцати пять"" (Bez pyatnadtsati pyat', A quarter to five) along with a music video. In November, ""Тени"" (Teni, Shadows) was released.
In 2016, the band released an album of songs in Russian called ОЭЩ МАГЗИУ — a cryptic acronym in Russian, which can be transliterated in English as OESCH MAGZIU.
In 2018, Glintshake's cover of Talking Heads' song ""Psycho Killer"" was used in the film Leto.

Peacock_chair,Start,1,"The peacock chair is a chair made of woven rattan or bamboo with a flared back, originated in the Philippines. It became popular in the United States and abroad during the 20th century, as a thronelike symbol of status, being featured in photographies with politicians, revolutionary leaders, actors and musicians.


== History ==
The peacock chair is one of several wicker chair designs to be originated from Asia and popularized in the US after the 1876's Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition.
It is believed this particular design originated in the Philippines, as a chair produced by inmates of the Bilibid prison in the early 20th-century.  During the American colonial period, the prison was espoused by colonizers as a 'benevolent' institution, where prisoners in rehabilitation programs made articles like furniture, silverware and baskets. The products were exposed at the prison workshop and sold to tourists.
One of the first peacock chair photos to popularize the model was featured in the May 16–17, 1914 edition of the El Paso Herald, with a female inmate from the Philippine with her baby was sat on it.


== Design ==
The chair has an hourglass shaped base, lifted arms and a woven flared back resembling a peacock's tail.


== Symbol ==
With the popularization of photography, photographers employed wicker chairs as a prop seat for its sturdy, lightweight appearance. The peacock chair acquired a status symbol, with its thronelike appearance, favored for shoots with politicians, artists and celebrities. The 1967 Blair Stapp photograph of Huey P. Newton, founder of the Black Panther Party, sitting on the chair with a spear and a rifle in each hand, became especially notable as a Black power movement icon.
The peacock chair was also featured on the screen, like Morticia Addams' chair in the 1964 television series The Addams Family. The chair also appeared in film, like My Fair Lady  (1964), Emmanuelle (1972) and Black Panther (2018).
The peacock chair was a trend in album covers, such as Al Green's I'm Still in Love With You (1972), Dorothy Moore's Misty Blue (1976), Al di Meola's Casino (1978), Funkadelic's Uncle Jam Wants You (1979) and Heaven 17's Play to Win (1981).

Its founder and president, Lisa Price, established the brand in May 1993 in Brooklyn, New York City. The brand was named after Lisa Price's mother, Carol. The beauty brand offers a range of hair, body, and skincare products.
In October 2014, the brand was acquired by L'Oréal USA.


== History ==
Price started the brand as a ""side hustle"" from her kitchen table in Brooklyn, New York City in the late 1980s. It initially started as a hobby while she was working full-time in television production, notably on ""The Cosby Show"" and its spin-off ""Here and Now"". She first began experimenting with fragrances and essential oils, which grew into an exploration of body care products. After gifting the homemade products to friends and family, her mother, Carol, implored her to start a business. Her mother died in 2003.
In 1993, Price began selling her products through word-of-mouth in her Bedford–Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn, and at local flea markets and craft fairs, building-up a loyal, devoted customer base.  The first Carol's Daughter boutique opened in Fort Greene, Brooklyn in 1999.  In 2000, the brand launched its e-commerce website. In 2002, Price was featured on the Oprah Winfrey Show, which gave her brand an enormous ""Oprah Effect"" boost. In 2005, Will Smith, Jada Pinkett Smith, and Jay-Z were among a group of movie and music stars who invested $10 million USD into Price's brand to help expand its nationwide reach. Other investors included record executive Steve Stoute, investor Andrew Farkas, Interscope Records chief Jimmy Iovine, and music executive Tommy Mottola and his wife, singer Thalía.
In 2008, Carol's Daughter launched on HSN. In 2010, HSN partnered with Mary J. Blige and Carol's Daughter for an exclusive, inaugural fragrance called ""My Life"", which rolled-out with an eau de parfum in a limited edition gold clutch, a shower cream, a body lotion, and an eau de parfum rollerpen.
In March 2014, Carol's Daughter launched an exclusive collection with Target.
In April 2014, the brand filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection with the Manhattan bankruptcy court. The brand's chief financial officer, John D. Elmer, stated that most of Carol's Daughter stores had been unprofitable since 2010. Before filing papers, the company closed five of its seven retail stores, and terminated 29 of its 42 employees.
Six months later, in October 2014, Carol's Daughter was acquired by L'Oréal USA.
Price's story is frequently cited as an example of the entrepreneurial success story of a ""minority-owned business that caters primarily to women of color"".

Fake_snow,Start,1,"Fake snow is any product which simulates the appearance and texture of snow, without being made from frozen crystalline water.
Fake snow has been made from many materials.  In the early 1900s, decorative snow was sometimes made from borax flakes and even ammonia. 
Before the dangers of asbestos were known, the substance was sold for Christmas tree decoration. Gypsum was also used to simulate snow in films, including The Wizard of Oz and Citizen Kane. Actor Lon Chaney died after fake snow was lodged in his throat.
Fake snow has also been sold in spray cans which could apply the flocking to windows and indoor displays.


== Film and theatre ==

When snow-like scenery is needed in live theatre, materials have included feathers, cotton, paper, breakfast cereal and potato flakes. To reduce the cleanup problem, many theatres use ""snow generators"" which create soapy white bubbles which disappear after a short time.  A similar process has been used in film studios and backlots; one well-known example is It's a Wonderful Life.
For outdoor film scenes needing large amounts of fake snow, salt was an inexpensive choice, but damaging to soil and plant life. Gypsum and bleached or painted cereal flakes have often been used; a less noisy alternative is paper, which is shredded and spread by specially-built machines.
Newer technology has created biodegradable, eco-friendly fake snow made of food grade ingredients that dissolve in the rain without leaving residue. Cellulose and other types leave harmful residue when they get wet.

Against_a_Wen,Start,1,"""Against a Wen"" is an Old English metrical charm and medical text found in the London, British Library, Royal MS. 4A.XIV. It appears to describe a remedy for ridding oneself of a wen, which is an Old English term for a cyst or skin blemish. The charm is addressed to the wen itself, asking it to leave. The charm prescribes methods for curing the blemish, and describes it as it gradually shrinks until it disappears.


== Charm Genre ==
Along with eight other of the Anglo-Saxon Metrical charms, Grendon classifies the ""Against a Wen"" charm under class A: ""Exorcisms of diseases or disease-spirit"" due to its verbal incantation element. The performative speech within a ritual context is a defining feature of the charm genre. Characteristics common to the charm genre which appear in the ""Against a wen"" charm include an explanatory title, instructions or directions to carry out the ritual and a written incantation or chant. It is also classified within the category of dealing with demon-disease a common element to the charm genre where the perceived demon or spirit is lured out with flattery or threat. The ""Against a wen"" charm employs the former tactic of a cajoling tone when addressing the wen and asking it to leave. Rather than performing the charm on a person, the patient's body is perceived as the host for an evil spirit in which the ritual attempts to expel.


== Christianity and the Charm ==
Pagan idols were replaced with Christian substitutes such as “Christ”, saints or the disciples and any mention of the original pagan gods were eradicated. The clergy viewed the pagan practise of charms as demonic. Aelfric's collection of Old English homilies and saints' lives found in MS li.1.33 in the Cambridge University Library. His homily on the passion of Saint Bartholomew the Apostle (folios 82r to 91r) documents his condemnation of such practises and features a warning against the use of heathen magic in which he outlines the Christian parameters within which medicinal rituals are acceptable.
The wise Augustine said, that it is not perilous, though any one eat a medicinal herb; but he reprehends it as an unallowed charm, if any one bind those herbs on himself, unless he lay them on a sore. Nevertheless we should not set our hope in medicinal herbs, but in the Almighty Creator, who has given that virtue to those herbs. No man shall enchant a herb with magic, but with God's words shall bless it, and so eat it.[1]
Out of the twelve Anglo-Saxon Metrical charms, nine contain religious references and five ending with Amen.

The project is released under Creative Commons BY-SA license and the CAD files can be downloaded from the official website, last release was in May 2015. The chassis can be assembled in less than 45 minutes and is able to carry two to four passengers.


== History ==
OSVehicle was founded by Macedonian Francisco Liu, who former cooperated with Cagiva, Husqvarna und Giorgetto Giugiaro.  Liu developed the framework of the car together with Italian mechanical engineer Ampelio Macchi who had been 51 times world champion as a motorbike racer.
10 different models were assembled live for the first time on 10 October 2013 at the Italian car fair Maker Faire di Roma to demonstrate the various possible applications.
The first model ""Urban Taddy"" designed by the official OSVehicle design-partner Marco Borge was presented on 5. November 2013 at the motorbike faire EICMA.
OSVehicle was rebranded on its 4th anniversary 2014 to Open Motors.
To meet higher requirements the platform was redesigned as Tabby EVO in 2015.


== Design ==
The Tabby is primarily a platform with an engine, suspension, steering and brakes. An internal combustion engine, hybrid engine or electric motor could be installed as the rear engine. Depending on requirements, it has 2, 3 or 4 wheels and 2 or 4 seats.
""Anyone can build their own customised vehicle, designers, the automotive industry, but also amateurs and enthusiasts"" is how Liu described the philosophy of his car kit.
With the open source software FreeCAD, anyone with basic technical knowledge should - so the claim of the developers - be able to build their own car. All they need to do is assemble the components delivered by post according to the construction plan downloaded from the website.
Prices in 2014 ranged from 1990 euros for the two-seater platform to 2,990 euros for the four-seater. The 4 kW electric motor cost 1,520 euros, the battery pack 698 euros, a pair of seats 80 euros and four 15-inch aluminum wheels 338 euros.

Bucket_crusher,Start,1,"A bucket crusher or crusher bucket is a type of jaw crusher. It's an attached tool for excavators for built-in crushing construction waste and demolition materials. It has the design of a shovel, which is open at the rear for releasing the shredded material. Compared to normal jaw crushers, The jaw crusher bucket has a lower production, but can be transported more easily and only needs an excavator to operate.
The jaws are driven by hydraulically actuated eccentrics which crush material to a desired particle size. Bucket crushers are primarily employed in mining and demolition for the breaking-down of crude minerals, concrete and masonry.
During the crushing process, the crusher bucket is positioned vertically so that the crushed material can be released. The jaw bucket works with the hydraulic system of the excavator. The hoses to the excavator, for intake and drain the oil are connected directly to the crusher bucket. A hydraulic valve block regulates the oil flow and the oil pressure to the correct amount of the hydraulic motor leave. The movement is transferred to one of the two crushing jaws, the other stops. 
Crusher buckets can differ in size and weight (1,500–5,620 kilograms (3,310–12,390 lb)) and volume (0.5–1.05 cubic metres (18–37 cu ft)). The distance between the crushing jaws can range from 970 to 1,650 millimetres (38 to 65 in).
Most patents on bucket crushers were filed in the mid 1990s, expiring around the year 2020.

Eurostar_Group,Start,1,"Eurostar Group is a holding company founded by SNCF Voyageurs, Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, NMBS/SNCB, and Federated Hermes Infrastructure in 2022. It aims at merging the operations of Thalys and Eurostar high-speed rail services between France, United Kingdom, Belgium, Netherlands, and Germany.


== History ==
In September 2019, Eurostar and Thalys shareholders introduced a plan to merge the two companies, a project named Green Speed. Both companies already operate in France, Belgium, and the Netherlands, with Eurostar also operating in the United Kingdom, and Thalys also operating in Germany, and SNCF already owns a majority stake in both of them. The project aims at reducing costs, and at providing a more seamless experience to passengers, with the use of a single ticketing system and loyalty program.
After being delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the project resumed in October 2021. It was announced that both services would be operated under the Eurostar brand, the Thalys brand being dropped, with the existing Eurostar service being renamed Eurostar Blue and the existing Thalys service Eurostar Red.
The European Commission approved the planned merger on 29 March 2022.
In April 2022, the new holding company, Eurostar Group, was established in Belgium. It is owned by the previous shareholders of Eurostar and Thalys, with SNCF retaining its majority stake.


== Criticism ==
The European Passengers’ Federation believes that the merger will give the new company a monopoly position of the market they serve, and lead to higher ticket prices for passengers.


== Passenger numbers and revenue ==
In January 2024, Eurostar Group announced that its passenger numbers in 2023 are back to pre-Covid levels, as total passenger numbers reached 18.9 million in 2023, a 22% increase from 2022 numbers. Eurostar Group's stated target is to reach 30 million passengers by 2030.

Ogcocephalus_pumilus,Start,1,"Ogcocephalus pumilus, the dwarf batfish, is a species of ray-finned fish belonging to the family Ogcocephalidae, the deep sea batfishes. It is found in the western Atlantic Ocean. It is the smallest species in the genus Ogcocephalus.


== Taxonomy ==
Ogcocephalus pumilus was first formally described in 1980 by the American ichthyologist Margaret G. Bradbury with its type locality given as Suriname at 7°5'N, 54°8'W, Oregon station 2018, from a depth of 35 fathoms (210 ft; 64 m).  The genus Ogcocephalus is classified within the ""Eastern Pacific/Western Atlantic clade"" of the family Ogcocephalidae. The family Ogcocephalidae is classified in the monotypic suborder Ogcocephaloidei within the order Lophiiformes, the anglerfishes in the 5th edition of Fishes of the World.


== Etymology ==
Ogcocephalus pumilus is a member of the genus Ogcocephalus, the name of which is a combination of ogkos, which means “hook”, and cephalus, meaning “head”, an allusion to the pointed rostrum on the snout snout of the type species. The specific name pumilus, means ""small"", ""little"", ""dwarfish"" or ""diminutive"", a reference to the size of this species, the smallest fish in its genus.


== Description ==
Ogcocephalus pumilus has a low, flattened head and a triangular disc, with a pointed snout and a long slender rostrum. The esca has 3 fleshy points and it is retracted into a small illicial cavity beneath the rostrum. The eyes are on the sides of the head and it has a relatively small mouth. There is a blunt, poorly developed, simple spine on the lower, posterior angle of the operculum. The gill rakers are oval shaped plates which are covered in small teeth and the gill openings are small, opening behind the upper base of the pectoral fin, this fin and the pelvic fin's are limb-like with the pectoral fins not widely attached to the body. The dorsal and anal fins are small, the dorsal fin is covered in skin and is on the tail while the anal fin is fleshy and under the tail. he upper surface of the body is covered in large buckler-like scales and with conical spines, the lower surface of the body has a complete covering of pointed, bony scales and the underside of the tail has a dense covering of small spines, apart from a few conical spines on its midline. The overall colour is light grey, perhaps with a few pale grey spots but otherwise rather uniform. The maximum published standard length is 6.1 cm (2.4 in).


== Distribution and habitat ==
Ogcocephalus pumilus is found in the Western Atlantic Ocean where it has been recorded off the coast ofSurname and in the Caribbean where its presence has been confirmed from the Bahamas, Guyana, Honduras, Puerto Rico, Trinidad & Tobago and the United States Virgin Islands. Its presence elsewhere in the Caribbean needs to be confirmed. It is found at depths between 35 and 348 m (115 and 1,142 ft), on soft substrates.

Can_seamer,Start,1,"A can seamer is a machine used to seal the lid to the can body. The lid or ""end"" is usually tinplated steel (food) or aluminum (drinks) while the body can be of metal (such as cans for beverages and soups), paperboard (whisky cans) or plastic.
The seam formed is generally leak proof, but this depends on the product being canned. The seam is made by mechanically overlapping the two layers to form a hook.
Different parameters of the hook are measured and monitored to check the integrity of the seam under different conditions.
The shape of the double seam is determined by the shape of the seamer roll profile and the relative position. During the can seaming process, the seamer chuck holds the can while the rolls rotate around it. Initially, the first operation roll folds the lid (end) and then the second operation rolls tightens the resulting seam.
The first operation seam is critical to avoid problems like wrinkles (tightness issues) and leaks. The shape of the seam is determined by the shape of the first operation roll, the second operation roll, their relative positions and distances, lifter height, lifter pressure. Any damage or problems to the seamer or seamer tools can cause severe problems to the double seam like seam bumps, wrinkles, sharp seams, and open seams.


== Can seamer setup ==
Seamer setup is usually done by an experienced individual, typically using a lifter height gauge, lifter height pressure gauge, and feeler gauges (small pieces of metal for go/no go testing of the distances between the roll and chuck toolings). New products like the clearance gauge are able to let even novice users adjust seamers and optimize them, as well as locate problems with broken/damaged tooling, shank/bushing issues, seamer adjustment issues, or broken bearings.


== Applications ==
Some common can seamer applications include, but are not limited to:

Cans
Automotive filters (oil and fuel)
Capacitors
Certain automotive mufflers (silencers)
Drums

Battle_of_Al_Khankah,Start,1,"The battle of Al Khankah was a military engagement between the Ottomans and the French army that took place near Cairo. The Ottomans successfully defeated the French, marking the beginning of the end of the French occupation of Egypt.


== Background ==
As the Ottoman army, led by the Grand Vizier, Yusuf Ziyaüddin Pasha, approached Cairo, the combined armies reached to the other side. The British general, John Hely-Hutchinson, sent a request for the Grand Vizier to halt his march instead of taking a risky engagement with the French; however, Yusuf refused. The French, led by Augustin Daniel Belliard, decided to take out the Ottoman army before the arrival of the British, as they did not have enough men to defend the city. The French army marched out of Cairo with 4,600 infantry, 900 cavalry, and 24 cannons on May 15.


== Battle ==
The French were on reconnaissance. The Ottoman army spotted the French at the springs of Al Khankah. Yusuf then dispatched Tahir Pasha with 3,000 men and 3 guns to attack the French at night. The Ottomans ran into the French, and both sides lay down their arms until the next day. Tahir then attacked the French and was reinforced with 1,500 cavalry and 5,000 Albanians led by Muhammad Ali Pasha. The French took up positions in palm trees, where they exchanged fire with Ottoman sharpshooters for three hours. Belliard attempted to go on offense and formed two large square formations. However, the Ottomans, instructed by British officers, avoided getting close to them, but at the same time, they used their cavalry to combat the enemy sharpshooters. The Bashi Bazouks began swarming around them and firing at a safe distance. Frustrated, Belliard attempted to attack, but the Ottomans swarmed on his flanks. French ammunition and supplies began running out, and more Ottoman reinforcements had come to join the battle. Accepting defeat, Belliard was forced to retreat towards Cairo, and the Ottomans began chasing them for 7 miles before stopping.


== Aftermath ==
The French had suffered 350 deaths and wounds, while the Ottomans suffered 150. For the first time, the Ottoman army was able to defeat the French in open battle and settle the campaign. Had the Ottomans lost, Cairo would remain under French control and force Hutchinson to retreat. The battle marked the beginning of the end of the French occupation of Egypt.

Gonset_Communicator,Start,1,"The Gonset Communicator was a series of vacuum tube VHF AM radio transceivers that were widely sold in the 1950s and early 60s. They were designed by Faust Gonsett and manufactured by the Gonset Division of L. A. Young Spring and Wire Corp. Models were built for amateur radio, aircraft radio and U.S. Civil Defense use.  The Gonsets were among the first commercial radios available for the post-World War II amateur bands and helped popularize VHF for amateurs.
The Gonset Communicators were packaged in a square box with a carrying handle and a UHF connector for the antenna  on top, making them quite portable. Early models had a magic eye tube tuning indicator in front.  The configuration earned them the name ""Gooney Box.""  The radios could operate from 110 volt AC mains, or 6 or 12 volt DC from a car battery. A simple whip antenna could be plugged into the antenna connector on top. The transmit/receive switch was on the front panel, not the microphone. The Gonset could also be connected to an external speaker and used as a public address (PA) system.

The Gonset's receiver was manually tuned  over the unit's frequency range with an analog dial, while the transmitter frequency was controlled by a crystal oscillator. The original model had a single jack on the front panel for an FT-243 style crystal.  A chain of frequency multipliers allowed crystals in the 8 MHz range to be used. Many such crystals were available as military surplus in the 1950s. Later models had jacks for four crystals with a switch to select which one to use.  Models were available for the 6 meter and 2 meter amateur bands, as well for as the VHF aircraft airband where they were often used as ground stations at smaller airfields.  The civil defense model was painted yellow with CD insignia, and was available for the 6 and 2 meter bands.  The 2 meter model was also used for the Civil Air Patrol, and could cover CAP frequencies which were adjacent to the 2 meter amateur band. A ten-meter model was also made.
The first model, introduced in the November 1952 QST Magazine, sold for $189.90.  The model II, introduced in 1954 cost $230. It added the bank of transmit crystals and included knobs for the transmitter tuning controls, which required a screwdriver in the original. The model III was white and had a meter instead of the magic eye. The model IV switched to a lower profile package.


== Other amateur equipment ==
Contemporary with the Communicators, Gonset also made a full line of amateur equipment.  Standouts were the converters and the G-76 transceiver.  The converters enabled a car radio to pick up ham signals.  The G-76 was among the first multiband HF transceivers.  It pioneered the ""station in a box"" form factor that is common today (2018).

The_Floppy_Show,Start,1,"The Floppy Show is an American children's television series starring Duane Ellett, broadcast on NBC affiliate WHO-TV in Des Moines, Iowa from 1957 to 1987. Ellett created Floppy in early 1957 to help teach people how to take care of their pets on the TV show Pet Corner, before moving on to their own show.


== Overview ==
Duane Ellett entertained children with his puppet friend Floppy, a high-voiced beagle that enjoyed riddles and let kids beep his nose for luck. Ellett had carved Floppy himself from balsa wood, and brought him and his other puppet characters to life through self-taught ventriloquism.
Duane Ellett and Floppy went on the air June 9, 1957. Prior to the show, Ellett had served in the U.S. Army in World War II. He had planned to become a lawyer when he started attending Drake University, but a class in radio journalism led to a job with WHO radio in 1947.
In the 1970s and 1980s, the half-hour show consisted of short sketches with Ellett's puppets, a segment in which children asked Floppy riddles, and the airing of vintage Looney Tunes and Tom and Jerry cartoons. Ellett also took Floppy on 200 personal appearances every year.
On August 30, 1984, WHO-TV canceled Ellett's afternoon show because of faltering ratings. Ellett and Floppy continued to appear on WHO's noon news and on weekend mornings. Ellett died in 1987.
The riddle that children most often asked of Floppy on the show was, ""Why did the man put the car in the oven?"" And the answer almost always was, ""Because he wanted a hot-rod."" Floppy never got it right and he never tired of hearing it.


== Specials and DVD release ==
Since the show's cancellation, WHO-TV has aired the Floppy Christmas Special, produced in 1966 on Christmas Eve. The special features the adventures of Floppy escaping the daily grind of his afternoon show. There are currently four DVDs released in the Duane and Floppy series.

In 1994, a special display honoring Ellett and his puppet was exhibited at the Iowa Historical Building, where Floppy now resides. In 2013, it was announced that the Iowa State Historical Society was intending to put the puppet in storage. The display will be taken down on June 9, 2013. This date also happens to be Floppy's 56th ""birthday"". A Facebook group called ""Save Floppy!"" created an online petition to keep the original version of the Floppy area on public display. As of July, 2013 Museum spokesman Jeff Morgan was noncommittal about restoring the Floppy exhibit to public display, saying, ""Right now the museum's just beginning to help determine what the exhibit rotations will be in the long term.""
The Iowa State Historical Society presented a retrospective ""Duane and Floppy Film Festival"" in 2009 and again in 2010.
On August 6, 2013, it was announced that Floppy would be on display at the 2013 Iowa State Fair from August 8 to the 18th.
 As of 2015, Floppy now resides at the Ankeny Area Historical Society's museum.

Nitrocefin,Start,1,"Nitrocefin is a chromogenic cephalosporin substrate routinely used to detect the presence of beta-lactamase enzymes produced by various microbes. Beta-lactamase mediated resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics such as penicillin is a widespread mechanism of resistance for a number of bacteria including members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, a major group of enteric Gram-negative bacteria. Other methods for beta-lactamase detection exist including PCR; however, nitrocefin allows for rapid beta-lactamase detection using few materials and inexpensive equipment.


== Structure ==
As a cephalosporin, nitrocefin contains a beta-lactam ring which is susceptible to beta-lactamase mediated hydrolysis. Once hydrolyzed, the degraded nitrocefin compound rapidly changes color from yellow to red. Although nitrocefin is considered a cephalosporin, it does not appear to have antimicrobial properties.


== Degradation and chromogenic properties ==
Intact beta-lactam antibiotics act by binding to penicillin binding proteins (PBPs) involved in peptidoglycan synthesis. Beta-lactamases hydrolyze the amide bond between the carbonyl carbon and the nitrogen in the beta-lactam ring of susceptible beta-lactams and members of beta-lactam subclasses (including certain cephalosporins). After hydrolysis of the amide bond, the antibiotic lacks the ability to bind bacterial PBPs and is rendered useless. Visual detection of this process is essentially impossible with most cephalosporins because the shift of ultraviolet absorption from the intact versus hydrolyzed product occurs outside of the visible spectrum. Hydrolysis of nitrocefin however, produces a shift of ultraviolet absorption inside the visible light spectrum from intact (yellow) nitrocefin (~380 nm) to degraded (red) nitrocefin (~500 nm) allowing visual detection of beta-lactamase activity on a macroscopic level.


== Detection assays ==
The following assays describe methods in which nitrocefin can be used to detect beta-lactamase enzymes using inexpensive materials and equipment. Working solutions of nitrocefin lie within 0.5 mg/mL to 1.0 mg/mL.
Slide Surface Assay

Add one drop of 0.5 mg/ml Nitrocefin to the surface of a clean glass slide.
Select a colony from an agar surface using a sterile loop and mix with the drop.
Appearance of red color within 20-30 min. indicates beta-lactamase activity.
Direct Contact Assay

Place one drop of 0.5 mg/ml Nitrocefin directly on the surface of an isolated colony.
Appearance of red color within 20-30 min. indicates beta-lactamase activity.
Broth Suspension Assay

Add 3-5 drops of 0.5 mg/ml Nitrocefin to 1 ml of broth suspension.
Appearance of red color within 20-30 min. indicates beta-lactamase activity.
Lysed Cell Assay

Lyse 1ml of cell suspension by sonication.
Add 3-5 drops of 0.5 mg/ml Nitrocefin to lysed cell suspension.
Appearance of red color within 20-30 min. indicates beta-lactamase activity.
Filter Paper Assay

Place a small piece of filter paper (~3 x 3 cm) in a clean petri dish or another clean isolated surface and saturate (3-5 ml) with 0.5 mg/ml Nitrocefin
Select an isolated colony and smear over the surface of the impregnated filter paper.
Appearance of red color within 20-30 min. indicates beta-lactamase activity

Dilang,Start,1,"Dilang (Chinese: 地狼; pinyin: Dì láng; Wade–Giles: Ti4 Lang2; lit. 'Earth Wolf') and Xiquan (Chinese: 犀犬; pinyin: Xī quǎn; Wade–Giles: Hsi1 Ch'üan3; lit. 'Hole Dog') are  canines that, according to Chinese legend, live underground. The 4th-century BC text Shizi states: ""If there be a dog under the earth, it is called ti-lang [dilang]."" They are also called Jia (simplified Chinese: 贾; traditional Chinese: 賈).


== Stories ==
According to Gan Bao's 4th-century story collection In Search of the Supernatural, during the yuankang period (c. 291–299) of Emperor Hui of Jin's reign, a man named Huai Yao (懷瑤) in Lou County (婁縣), Wu Commandery discovered two underground Xiquan puppies, ""one male and a female, whose eyes had not yet opened"", both of which were larger than normal dogs. He had begun to dig into the earth after hearing ""distant sounds of dogs"" and discovering a burrow hole ""the size of a serpent's retreat"". After Huai returned the puppies to their den and covered it with an old grindstone, he failed to find it the next day.
Gan Bao's book also mentioned another discovery, that of the Grand Protector of Wu Commandery, Zhang Mao (張茂), which supposedly took place during the taixing period (c. 318–321) of Emperor Yuan of Jin's reign. Zhang had heard sounds of dogs beneath his bed but could not find the source; finally the earth cracked open and revealed two puppies. He tried to rear them, but they both died; later, in the year 322, he was killed during Wang Dun's rebellion.
A similar story is found in the official historical text Book of Jin (648) about Sun Wuzhong (孫無終), a general under Emperor Xiaowu of Jin, who found two white puppies, also one gender each, under his residence in Jiyang County (既陽縣). Sun also tried but failed to rear them; he was soon killed in 402 by the rebel Huan Xuan. 
According to the same chapter in Book of Jin, in the year 434, a man named He Xu (何旭) in Qian County (灊縣) also found two puppies underground; their thin and ""blue"" mother escaped. He Xu also tried to rear them; the female died but the male survived and grew to be ""good at devouring beasts"". Later, He Xu's village was destroyed by ""barbarians"".
The Ming dynasty government official Xie Zhaozhe (謝肇淛; 1567–1624) mentioned a ""recent"" story from Changzhou (長洲): for several nights puppy sounds were heard from underground; but nothing was discovered after much digging.

Level_playing_field,Start,1,"In commerce, a level playing field is a concept about fairness, not that each player has an equal chance to succeed, but that they all play by the same set of rules. 
In a game played on a playing field, such as rugby, one team would have an unfair advantage if the field had a slope. Since some real-life playing fields do in fact have slopes, it is customary for teams to swap ends of the playing field at half time. 
A metaphorical playing field is said to be level if no external interference affects the ability of the players to compete fairly. 
Some government regulations are intended to provide such fairness, since all participants must abide by the same rules. However, they can have the opposite effect, for example if larger firms find it easier to pay for fixed costs of regulation. It may be added that if the rules affect different participants differently, then they are not actually the same.
Handicapping might be thought of as the opposite concept, of unequal rules designed to make the outcome of play more equal.


== Examples ==
Governments, regulators and sports associations may try to create a 'level playing field'.
Examples of such regulation: building codes, material specifications and zoning restrictions, which create a starting point / a minimum standard --- a ""level playing field"".


=== Education ===
Students from low-income families can be considered for a scholarship so they are able to study at a university. (opposite of a handicap; see below)


=== Web 2.0 ===
In the past, being a published author was easier for select few, due to barriers to entry. With the advent of worldwide internet connectivity, it is now easier for many people to publish their writing, through websites, wikis such as Wikipedia, and self-publishing platforms.


=== Automobile Industry ===
Manufacturers must prove that each car being offered is ""safe"" to drive.


=== Sports ===
Each team is allowed to field the same number of players as the opposing team.
Formula 1 cars and their drivers all have been submitted to the same set of rules before participating in a race. Even the combination of the weight of the car and driver has been corrected and made equal in relationship to their opponents.


== Subjectivity ==
What is meant to ""level the playing field"" can be subjective, for example when a regulation does not change the probability distribution of outcomes. For example, the fact that all companies are required to pay the same rate of corporate income tax could be described as ""creating a level playing field"", while some may say that this does not level the playing field, because while the requirements are equal for all companies, larger companies may have more resources from which to pay the tax.


=== Examples ===
Describing different rules for different people as a ""level playing field"":
""Sainsbury's chief executive Justin King has attacked the government for creating an unfair burden on high-street retailers by not doing more to tax online-only rivals such as Amazon. He called for a level playing field and said politicians should take action or risk seeing the high street shrink further. King said: 'The burden of taxation in the UK falls very heavily on bricks-and-mortar retailers versus internet only retailers.'""

Roky_Moon_and_Bolt,Start,1,"Roky Moon and Bolt! are an American glam rock band from Houston, Texas, United States.  They formed in late 2008, not performing live until March 2009.  The original lineup was a four-piece conceived by Mike Hardin; several additional musicians joined as the band's performances became increasingly frequent.  They were soon to be found on a variety of major shows around Houston, including each successive Free Press Summer Fest, and noteworthy appearances with such artists as Daniel Johnston, Tokyo Police Club, Bun B, and Indian Jewelry.


== History ==


=== Formation and first album ===
The band began to play heavily around Houston throughout 2009. By December of that year, they had been cast as the backing band for a Catastrophic Theatre production based on the life of Daniel Johnston titled ""Life is Happy and Sad."" The Houston Press had also twice recognized the new band in both their annual Music Awards and Best Of editions.
The Spring of 2010 was the first east coast tour for the band, and they began recording immediately after.  Roky Moon and Bolt! first appeared on an independently distributed compilation album, Summer Exposure, as well as the live compilation from KTRU Rice Radio, titled KTRU Live Vol 2.   This all led to a self-titled album recorded at Digital Warehaus Studios over the course of the summer, to be released in November 2010 on Homeskool Rekordz.
It was during this period that the band appeared on Live From SugarHill Studios - Episode 18, which first caught the attention of Zenhill Records.


=== American Honey ===
Roky Moon and Bolt! signed with Zenhill Records soon after the first album's release.  The second album was recorded at SugarHill Recording Studios on January 17, 2011.  Producer/President Dan Workman spearheaded the recording, as well as conceptualized the 'One Day Record.'  The album was recorded as planned, in four complete takes of the entire piece with Zenfilm crews adjusting cameras and resetting in between. American Honey was released on July 30, 2011, at Fitzgerald's; the first footage from the recording of the album surfaced on the same day.


=== Break up ===
The band planned to perform its final show at the 2012 Free Press Summer Fest, but cancelled. After re-uniting in 2014 for a trio of shows in Houston and Austin, the band has resumed activity and now plays regularly.


=== Other work ===
Material has been compiling throughout the life of the band to finish what is apparently a near-complete rock opera.  Talks with Catastrophic Theatre were underway over producing the show in 2010, but a recording schedule and increasing performance conflicts delayed the project.  The show, penned by Roky Moon and comic book artist Becky Cloonan is tentatively titled ""The Man Who Couldn't Save The World,"" a sci-fi drama centering on a troubled figure named Avory, and was on track to be produced and performed in conjunction with the release of the accompanying soundtrack album in 2018.

"Thomas_Jefferson_School_(Sacramento,_California)",Start,1,"The Thomas Jefferson School is a historic elementary school building located in Sacramento, California designed in the Tudor Revival style. Designed by Sacramento School District’s Architectural and Engineering Commission Chairman E.C. Hemmings and James S. Dean of local architecture firm Dean & Dean, and built by Robert Trost.


== History ==
The original Jefferson School building, constructed in 1870, was the oldest in Sacramento, before it was expanded as part of a school building program planned in the 1920s. The original building was considered too small and did not have enough windows to allow for sufficient sunlight.
In 1919 Superintendent of Schools Charles C. Hughes proposed a bond to fund a district-wide program of school construction, seeking to build three new schools including a high school. It also looked to add to two schools and abandon and rebuild seven existing schools, including Jefferson School, on new sites. Many of the old school buildings were too small for the growing population and wood-framed, which was vulnerable to fire. The $2,304,000 was passed by Sacramento voters in October 1919.
In November 1919, local architects appealed to the Board of Education to appoint an architectural commission that would design the school bond projects and be paid 6% of project costs. The directors were hesitant and wanted to reuse existing school plans, but architect E.C. Hemmings insisted the buildings be unique and that it would save on costs. In April 1920, the board appointed an Architectural and Engineering Commission consisting of architects Hemmings and Jens Peterson with structural engineer George Hudnutt, for a 4.5% commission. Hemmings was chairman of the commission and responsible for the plans and designs of the projects.
Although the original plans looked to abandon the original building, the District was able to acquire the remainder of the south half of the site's block for $33,000. That spring, the contract for Hemmings-Peterson-Hudnutt was transferred to newly formed Dean and Dean.  The school architecture program carried on smoothly, as James S. Dean had been working on the Jefferson School design since the commission's inception.
Jefferson School became a distribution center for sugar rations during WWII.  The building was converted to administrative offices in 1949, where it was used until 2009 when it was converted to storage. $270,000 was budgeted and plans included construction of a school supply warehouse. Charles Dean was architect, with Harry Devine as supervising architect. The original building had its interior almost completely gutted and renovated. Additionally, a two-story addition was built at the rear (north) of the building, along with a one-story east wing. The 1948–1949 school year was the last time students attended school at the site.
In 2022, plans were proposed to restore and turn the building into modern housing.

Vlaams_Wielercentrum_Eddy_Merckx,Start,1,"The Flemish Cycling Center Eddy Merckx is a sport complex with indoor cycling track in the Belgian city of Ghent. It is named after the famous Belgian road and track cyclist Eddy Merckx.
The venue hosted the 1988 UCI Track Cycling World Championships and the 2009 European Track Cycling Championships, and for years it is the permanent location of the Belgian National track championships.


== History ==
In 1988, the open-air track ""Blaarmeersen"" was built in the Blaarmeersen recreation center close to the Watersportbaan in Ghent. The Track Cycling World Championships were organized there that same year. The weather conditions during these world championships were so bad that the competitions had to be postponed several times and the program was delayed. On this basis, the UCI changed the regulations stating that from then on the track cycling world championships had to be organized on an indoor cycling track.
The concept of the semi-covered cycling track was mainly tailored to training. The cycling track itself, the oval on which the race took place, was considered one of the best in Europe, even in the world. However, the ancillary accommodations were minimal, such that extra stands had to be added for important championships.
In 2005, the Blaarmeersen slope was covered after a cooperation agreement between, among others, the Flemish Government, the Royal Belgian Cycling League, Bloso, and the City of Ghent. The ""Flemish Cycling Center Eddy Merckx"" was officially opened on February 17, 2006. The permanently covered track of 250 meters bears the name of multiple world champion Eddy Merckx.
The first important championships that took place were the Men's and woman's omnium races of the 2009 European Track Championships.
In 2019, it hosted the UEC European Track Championships (under-23 & junior).


== Other sports ==
On June 25, 2009, a BMX track was opened, a track that meets UCI standards. The course is 375 meters long, has 4 dolomite strips, 3 bends and a starting hill with fully automatic starting gates.
Other sports are also be practiced on the center square of the track. There are courts for handball, korfball, volleyball, badminton and cycle ball.

The Power of Generosity, Inventiveness, Courage. The Power of Flirting, Improvising, Blagging, Hard Work and Being Nice and Polite. The Power of Friendship, Faith, Obligation, Ambition, Anxiety…..Dreams. Without these Powers this track would not have been made. This song is precious. And yet, we’re told that ‘a single’ is almost valueless. And that pisses us off. So we have done a budget of how much this single ‘cost’. The many hours it took to write, arrange, compose, master; the expertise of all the musicians, technicians, designers, producers involved; the combination of all the Powers described above and more – we’ve totted it all up as best we can and… …we are putting this tune to market for the sum of £3000. The power of money? Let’s see.
Gaggle's music was included in the opening ceremony  for the London 2012 Paralympic Games.
In 2013, Gaggle opened a three-week Pop Up Adventure in Lifestyle, Craft & Noise with gallery, shop and workshops. It took place in at abandoned shop in New Cross. They also released a free app on iTunes.

Line–sphere_intersection,Start,1,"In analytic geometry, a line and a sphere can intersect in three ways:

No intersection at all
Intersection in exactly one point
Intersection in two points.
Methods for distinguishing these cases, and determining the coordinates for the points in the latter cases, are useful in a number of circumstances. For example, it is a common calculation to perform during ray tracing.

In vector notation, the equations are as follows:

Stop_action_magnet,Start,1,"The stop action magnet, usually abbreviated to SAM, is an electromagnetic device used for the control of pipe organs and virtual pipe organs, and forms part of the organ's combination action. On a classical organ the device may be referred to as a drawstop solenoid.
The SAM can be considered an electrical relay, the difference being that the SAM also has a drawknob or a tab, which enables it to be operated manually as well as electrically.
A SAM will have an armature which is operated by an electrically induced magnetic field and dependent on whether the SAM is being used with a drawknob or a tilting tablet on a classically voiced organ or with a flat tab on a theatre organ, the armature will move in either a linear fashion or with semi-circular movement, in a small defined arc. A drawknob or tab is attached to the armature to facilitate hand operation.
Each SAM consists of two coils of wire, wound on bobbins, which surround a single central, magnetically conductive pole piece or two separate pole pieces (determined by the designer) and will have one or more switching contacts or reed switches that are switched on or off by the movement of the armature. The switching contact is used to control which rank or ranks of pipes will sound when keys on a keyboard are depressed, although the actual 'rank switching' is often handled by a more complex electromagnetic or electronic relay system.
In mechanical operation using a SAM with a drawknob attached, a player will either pull the drawknob towards themselves to select an 'on' state, or push the drawknob away to select an 'off' state. The movement of the drawknob affects the state of the switch or reed contact. Similarly, with a SAM that utilises a tilting tablet, the player will tilt the tablet up or down by hand to operate it. With a theatre organ the tab attached to each SAM is raised or lowered by the player to operate the switch contact/s.
Whilst hand registering the organ is often carried out, this can only be used to facilitate small changes in the overall tonal colour, due to physical restrictions. i.e. The operator cannot operate more than one or two devices simultaneously, especially when using only one hand for registration, whilst playing keys with the other hand! This is where the true versatility of the SAM comes into play. By applying a low voltage electric current (usually between 12 and 30 volts at up to 0.5 ampere) to one or the other of a SAM's electromagnets (coils) the armature can be made to follow the same movement and thus operate its switching contact/s as if it had been actuated by a human operator. The advantage of electrical operation being that many SAMs can be electrically connected together and switched by the use of a single button (piston) depressed by the human player using only one finger. It can therefore be seen that operating many SAMs in simultaneous combination will have a far greater instantaneous effect on the sound of the organ (which is essential for tonal variety) than is achievable by the use of single SAMs. Furthermore, combinations of registration changes can be stored in electronic or electromechanical memory which forms part of the organ's combination action, for instant recall at the touch of a button (piston) and translated into electrical impulses used to operate multiple SAMs.
One further use of SAMs in multiples is to achieve instant cancellation of organ registrations either in banks or for the entire organ. Most organs will have a General Cancel button for the purpose of entire cancellation, whilst at least one style of pipe organ manufactured by the John Compton company in the 20th century uses an ingenious system known as Second Touch Cancel, where each SAM has an extra contact fitted which is operated by depressing any single SAM's tab past its normal 'on' position, and which serves to switch all associated SAMs in its department to the 'off' position.

Kaplansky's_conjectures,Start,1,"The mathematician Irving Kaplansky is notable for proposing numerous conjectures in several branches of mathematics, including a list of ten conjectures on Hopf algebras. They are usually known as Kaplansky's conjectures.


== Group rings ==
Let K be a field, and G a torsion-free group. Kaplansky's zero divisor conjecture states:

The group ring K[G] does not contain nontrivial zero divisors, that is, it is a domain.
Two related conjectures are known as, respectively, Kaplansky's idempotent conjecture:

K[G] does not contain any non-trivial idempotents, i.e., if a2 = a, then a = 1 or a = 0.
and Kaplansky's unit conjecture (which was originally made by Graham Higman and popularized by Kaplansky):

K[G] does not contain any non-trivial units, i.e., if ab = 1 in K[G], then a = kg for some k in K and g in G.
The zero-divisor conjecture implies the idempotent conjecture and is implied by the unit conjecture. As of 2021, the zero divisor and idempotent conjectures are open. The unit conjecture, however, was disproved in characteristic 2 by Giles Gardam by exhibiting an explicit counterexample in a crystallographic group, namely the fundamental group of the Hantzsche–Wendt manifold; see also Fibonacci group. A later preprint by Gardam claims that essentially the same element also gives a counter-example in characteristic 0 (finding an inverse is computationally much more involved in this setting, hence the delay between the first result and the second one). 
There are proofs of both the idempotent and zero-divisor conjectures for large classes of groups. For example, the zero-divisor conjecture is known for all torsion-free elementary amenable groups (a class including all virtually solvable groups), since their group algebras are known to be Ore domains. It follows that the conjecture holds more generally for all residually torsion-free elementary amenable groups. Note that when 
  
    
      
        K
      
    
    {\displaystyle K}
  
 is a field of characteristic zero, then the zero-divisor conjecture is implied by the Atiyah conjecture, which has also been established for large classes of groups.
The idempotent conjecture has a generalisation, the Kadison idempotent conjecture, also known as the Kadison–Kaplansky conjecture, for elements in the reduced group C*-algebra. In this setting, it is known that if the Farrell–Jones conjecture holds for K[G], then so does the idempotent conjecture. The latter has been positively solved for an extremely large class of groups, including for example all hyperbolic groups.
The unit conjecture is also known to hold in many groups, but its partial solutions are much less robust than the other two (as witnessed by the earlier-mentionned counter-example). This conjecture is not known to follow from any analytic statement like the other two, and so the cases where it is known to hold have all been established via a direct combinatorial approach involving the so-called unique products property. By Gardam's work mentioned above, it is now known to not be true in general.


== Banach algebras ==
This conjecture states that every algebra homomorphism from the Banach algebra C(X) (continuous complex-valued functions on X, where X is a compact Hausdorff space) into any other Banach algebra, is necessarily continuous. The conjecture is equivalent to the statement that every algebra norm on C(X) is equivalent to the usual uniform norm. (Kaplansky himself had earlier shown that every complete algebra norm on C(X) is equivalent to the uniform norm.)
In the mid-1970s, H. Garth Dales and J. Esterle independently proved that, if one furthermore assumes the validity of the continuum hypothesis, there exist compact Hausdorff spaces X and discontinuous homomorphisms from C(X) to some Banach algebra, giving counterexamples to the conjecture.
In 1976, R. M. Solovay (building on work of H. Woodin) exhibited a model of ZFC (Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory + axiom of choice) in which Kaplansky's conjecture is true. Kaplansky's conjecture is thus an example of a statement undecidable in ZFC.


== Quadratic forms ==
In 1953, Kaplansky proposed the conjecture that finite values of u-invariants can only be powers of 2.
In 1989, the conjecture was refuted by Alexander Merkurjev who demonstrated fields with u-invariants of any even m. In 1999, Oleg Izhboldin built a field with u-invariant m = 9 that was the first example of an odd u-invariant. In 2006, Alexander Vishik demonstrated fields with u-invariant

Mokoangai,Start,1,"Mokoangai or Mokuangai was a colonial station in the Congo Free State on the Ubangi River, beside the Mokoangai rapids. Above the station the Ubangi could easily be navigated up to Yakoma, where the Mbomou River and Uele River combine to form the Ubangi.


== Location ==
The middle part of the Ubangi, from Yakoma down to Mokoangai, is called the Dua.
It appears to be the bed of an ancient, long and narrow lake.
The waters draining the lake carved out the Zongo Gut, which cuts through a chain of hills that extends from east to west.
Ascending the Ubangi from Zongo the rapids in the colonial era were named Zongo, Bonga, Belly, En Avant, Elephant and Mokuangi, and covered a distance of 24 miles (39 km).
An 1888 map based on Alphonse van Gèle's observations shows the Songo rapids, then further east four rapids, ascending from southwest to northeast: Zawa Bonga, Belli, Mossuma and Mokuangai.
Elephanten Insel was between Mossuma and Mokuangai.
The banks of the river in this section when Van Gele visited in 1887 were bordered by gentle slopes with alternating woods, plains, maize fields and banana plantations.
The people around Mokuangi were Bakombe.
Above Mokuangi the river came down from the northeast for about 50 kilometres (31 mi), and was about 4 metres (13 ft) deep and 800 to 900m wide (2625ft to 2953ft).


== Early European presence ==
An expedition under Van Gèle left Equateur Station on 26 October 1887 in the steamer En Avant towing a large canoe that could hold 100 people.
It reached Zongo on 21 November 1887, and took three weeks to ascend the rapids, passing Mokuangai on 11 December 1887.
In 1889 Van Gèle and Georges Le Marinel studied the north shore of the Ubangi between Banzyville and Mokoangai and discovered the mouths of the Kuanga and Benghi rivers.
Louis Royaux (born 1866) joined the Congo Free State in 1892 and became the deputy of Florent-François-Marie Heymans in Zongo. 
He was then made station head in Banzyville and then Mokoangay. 
He ""pacified"" the regions for which he was responsible, before returning to Belgium in August 1895. 
Mokoangai was one or two hours upstream from the Elephant rapids.
In 1905 it had a large plantation and farm, and well built houses that lodged one or two resident Europeans.

False_documentation,Start,1,"False documentation is the process of creating documents which record fictitious events.  The documents can then be used to ""prove"" that the fictional events happened.  A common propaganda tool, false documentation is often used by management groups and totalitarian governments for four basic reasons:

to have a basis for accusations against groups or individuals who oppose those in authority,
to invoke hatred against certain racial, ethnic or religious groups (appeal to bigotry),
To support the actions of those in power (appeal to patriotism), and
To cover the mistakes of those in power (deniability).
Perhaps the best illustration of false documentation is Nazi Germany, where the authorities falsified documents for all four reasons.
There are three basic methods for falsifying documentation.  One way, of course, is to create an entirely fictional event and write it down.  The other is to misrepresent an actual incident by embellishment or exaggeration so that the blame for the incident is misplaced.  The third is to refuse to document an actual event, thereby exonerating the instigators for lack of proof.
The practice of false documentation rests on the fallacy, promoted by management organizations and governments, that whatever has been written down is unquestionably true.  In business, it rests on a further bias: the tendency of management to believe managers rather than to collect and objectively judge evidence.  As folklorist Jan Harold Brunvand points out, when a story or a claim appears in print, it gains an air of authority.  Many people are skeptical of spoken rumors, but few doubt the veracity of stories appearing in the news media.
A related fallacy is, of course, that whatever has not been documented must not have happened. Although absence of evidence is evidence of absence, whether any given event happened is entirely independent of whether it was documented.


== In popular culture ==
In George Orwell's novel 1984, the Ministry of Truth has an entire department devoted to altering past editions of newspapers in the belief that changing documentation will change the public's perception of history.  One of the novel's greatest ironies is that the Ministry of Truth deals exclusively in lies."

Dymaxion,Start,1,"Dymaxion is a term coined by architect and inventor Buckminster Fuller and associated with much of his work—prominently his Dymaxion house and Dymaxion car. Dymaxion, a portmanteau of the words dynamic, maximum, and tension; sums up the goal of his study, ""maximum gain of advantage from minimal energy input.""


== Description ==
A name was needed for the display of Fuller's first architectural model, later to be known as the Dymaxion house, at the Marshall Field's department store in Chicago. To create the name, wordsmith Waldo Warren was hired by Marshall Field's and spent two days listening to Fuller, getting a feel for his idiosyncratic use of language—later playing with the syllables typical of Fuller's speech until he and Fuller agreed on the word Dymaxion.
Fuller used the word for many of his inventions during the decades to follow, including the Dymaxion house, the Dymaxion deployment unit, the Dymaxion car, and the Dymaxion world map. Dymaxion also came to describe a polyphasic sleep schedule he followed, consisting of four 30-minute naps throughout the day. 
Fuller eventually renamed his elaborate journal—a highly specific, highly detailed self-documentation of his life—as the Dymaxion Chronofile.

Highway_Addressable_Remote_Transducer_Protocol,Start,1,"The HART Communication Protocol (Highway Addressable Remote Transducer) is a hybrid analog+digital industrial automation open protocol. Its most notable advantage is that it can communicate over legacy 4–20 mA analog instrumentation current loops, sharing the pair of wires used by the analog-only host systems. HART is widely used in process and instrumentation systems ranging from small automation applications up to highly sophisticated industrial applications.
HART is a in the OSI model a Layer 7, Application. Layers 3–6 are not used. When sent over 4–20 mA it uses a Bell 202 for layer 1. But it is often converted to RS485 or RS232. 

According to Emerson, due to the huge installation base of 4–20 mA systems throughout the world, the HART Protocol is one of the most popular industrial protocols today. HART protocol has made a good transition protocol for users who wished to use the legacy 4–20 mA signals, but wanted to implement a ""smart"" protocol.


== History ==
The protocol was developed by Rosemount Inc., built off the Bell 202 early communications standard in the mid-1980s as a proprietary digital communication protocol for their smart field instruments. Soon it evolved into HART and in 1986 it was made an open protocol. Since then, the capabilities of the protocol have been enhanced by successive revisions to the specification.


== Modes ==

There are two main operational modes of HART instruments: point-to-point (analog/digital) mode, and multi-drop mode.


=== Point to point ===
In point-to-point mode the digital signals are overlaid on the 4–20 mA loop current. Both the 4–20 mA current and the digital signal are valid signalling protocols between the controller and measuring instrument or final control element.
The polling address of the instrument is set to ""0"".  Only one instrument can be put on each instrument cable signal pair.  One signal, generally specified by the user, is specified to be the 4–20 mA signal.  Other signals are sent digitally on top of the 4–20 mA signal.  For example, pressure can be sent as 4–20 mA, representing a range of pressures, and temperature can be sent digitally over the same wires. In point-to-point mode, the digital part of the HART protocol can be seen as a kind of digital current loop interface.


=== Multi-drop ===
In multi-drop mode the analog loop current is fixed at 4 mA and it is possible to have more than one instrument on a signal loop.
HART revisions 3 through 5 allowed polling addresses of the instruments to be in the range 1–15. HART revision 6 allowed addresses 1 to 63; HART revision 7 allows addresses 0 to 63. Each instrument must have a unique address.


== Packet structure ==
The request HART packet has the following structure:


=== Preamble ===
Currently all the newer devices implement five byte preamble, since anything greater reduces the communication speed. However, masters are responsible for backwards support. Master communication to a new device starts with the maximum preamble length (20 bytes) and is later reduced once the preamble size for the current device is determined.
Preamble is: ""ff"" ""ff"" ""ff"" ""ff"" ""ff""  (5 times ff)


=== Start delimiter ===
This byte contains the Master number and specifies that the communication packet is starting.

bit 7, if high use Unique (5 byte) address, else use Poling (1 Byte) addresses.
bit 6 and 5, Number of Expansion bytes
normally it set if Expansion field is used, normally 0.
bit 4 and 3, Physical layer type
0=Asynchronous,  1=Synchronous
bit 2, 1 and 0, Frame type
1=BACK Burst Acknowledge send by Burst-mode Device 2=STX Master to Field Devices. 6=Slave  Acknowledge to STX frame.


=== Address ===
Specifies the destination address as implemented in one of the HART schemes. The original addressing scheme used only four bits to specify the device address, which limited the number of devices to 16 including the master.
The newer scheme utilizes 38 bits to specify the device address. This address is requested from the device using either Command 0, or Command 11.


=== Command ===
This is a one byte numerical value representing which command is to be executed.
Command 0 and Command 11 are used to request the device number.


=== Number of data bytes ===
Specifies the number of communication data bytes to follow.


=== Status ===
The status field is absent for the master and is two bytes for the slave. This field is used by the slave to inform the master whether it completed the task and what its current health status is.


=== Data ===
Data contained in this field depends on the command to be executed.


=== Checksum ===
Checksum is composed of an XOR of all the bytes starting from the start byte and ending with the last byte of the data field, including those bytes.


== Manufacturer codes ==
Each manufacturer that participates in the HART convention is assigned an identification number.  This number is communicated as part of the basic device identification command used when first connecting to a device.

However, if one person witnessed the accident and told the other one about it, then they would not be independent, since one would depend on the other for their information. Also, if two witnesses to an event discuss what they saw before they are consulted and agree on a consistent story, then they are also no longer independent. As another example, two scientific devices could be considered independent sources of measurement data, unless they shared the same wiring or electrical power supply (or similar factors).
Consulting multiple independent sources is a common technique for detecting errors and deception, as any divergences or contradictions between statements, or data samples, would likely indicate one of these.
The American judge Learned Hand declared that ""Right conclusions are more likely to be gathered out of a multitude of tongues, than through any kind of authoritative selection. To many this is, and will always be, folly; but we have staked upon it our all.""
The New York Times's minimal standard for reporting a fact not otherwise attributed to a single speaker is that it be verified by at least two independent sources.
Circular reporting is a situation where multiple sources appear to be independent, but in reality originate from a single source.  Because circular reporting can happen inadvertently in many situations, extra care must be taken to ensure that multiple sources actually are independent, rather than interconnected in an obscure manner.

Measure_word,Start,1,"In linguistics, measure words are words (or morphemes) that are used in combination with a numeral to indicate an amount of something represented by some noun. Many languages use measure words, and East Asian languages such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean use them very extensively in the form of number classifiers.


== Description ==
Measure words denote a unit of measurement and are used with mass nouns (uncountable nouns), and in some cases also with count nouns. For instance, in English, mud is a mass noun and thus one cannot say ""three muds"", but one can say ""three drops of mud"", ""three pails of mud"", etc. In these examples, drops and pails function as measure words. One can also say ""three pails of shells""; in this case the measure word pails accompanies a count noun (shells).
The term measure word is also sometimes used to refer to numeral classifiers, which are used with count nouns in some languages. For instance, in English no extra word is needed when saying ""three people"", but in many East Asian languages a numeral classifier is added, just as a measure word is added for uncountable nouns in English. For example:

There are numerous Chinese measure words, and nouns differ in what measure words they can use. While many linguists maintain a distinction between measure words and numeral classifiers, the terms are sometimes used interchangeably. For instance, materials for teaching Chinese as a second language generally refer to Chinese classifiers as ""measure words"". The corresponding Chinese term is liàngcí (simplified Chinese: 量词; traditional Chinese: 量詞), which can be directly translated as ""quantity word"".
Most measure words in English correspond to units of measurement or containers, and are themselves count nouns rather than grammatical particles:

one quart of water
three cups of coffee
four kernels of corn, three ears of corn,  two bushels of corn
Though similar in construction, fractions are not measure words. For example, in ""seven-eighths of an apple"" the fraction acts as a noun. Compare that to ""seven slices of apple"" where ""apple"" is a mass noun and does not require the article ""an"". Combining the two, e.g. ""seven-eighths of a slice of apple"", makes it clear the fraction must be a noun referring to a part of another countable noun.
In many languages, including the East Asian languages referred to above, the analogous constructions do not include any equivalent of the English of. In German, for example, ein Glas Bier means ""a glass [of] beer"". This is interesting since both languages are West Germanic languages, making them closely related to each other. However, the equivalent of the English of is common in Romance languages such as ""a glass of beer"":

Spanish: un vaso de cerveza
French: un verre de bière
Portuguese: um copo de cerveja


== Classifiers versus measure words ==
Classifiers play a similar role to measure words, except that measure words denote a particular quantity of something (a drop, a cupful, a pint, etc.), rather than the inherent countable units associated with a count noun. Classifiers are used with count nouns; measure words can be used with mass nouns (e.g. ""two pints of mud""), and can also be used when a count noun's quantity is not described in terms of its inherent countable units (e.g. ""two pints of acorns"").
However, the terminological distinction between classifiers and measure words is often blurred – classifiers are commonly referred to as measure words in some contexts, such as Chinese language teaching, and measure words are sometimes called mass-classifiers or similar.

Shaniwarwada_Elgar_Parishad,Start,1,"The Elgaar Parishad was an event held on 31 December 2017 to commemorate the two hundredth anniversary of the Battle of Koregaon Bhima. It was organised by a coalition of 260 non-profit organisations at Pune's Shaniwar Wada Fort, and had approximately 35,000 people in attendance. The program consisted of a number of cultural performances, speeches and slogans.
""Elgaar"" means loud invitation or loud declaration.


== Background ==
The event was organised at the Shaniwarwada Fort in Pune on the eve of the bicentennial anniversary of the Battle of Bhima Koregaon. The Shaniwarwada Fort was the seat of power of the Peshwas, the de facto rulers of the Maratha Empire. The Peshwas belonged to the 'Chitpavan Brahmin' community. In the Battle of Bhima Koregaon, a regiment of Mahar Dalits, serving in the British Army had defeated the Peshwa's army. This victory is held as very important by the Mahar Dalits, who see it as a victory over the Brahmin Peshwas. Organising the Parishad at the Shaniwarwada Fort was thus seen as a symbol of Dalit assertion. However Anand Teltumbde has argued that painting the Battle of Bhima Koregaon as the battle of Mahars against their caste oppression in Peshwa rule, is a ""pure myth"". He states that the majority of those died in the battle (27 out of 49) were not Mahars,  and the Peshwa army retreated, fearing the arrival of a larger British force. Thus he regards  portrayal of the battle as Mahars’  against the Peshwas’ Brahmanic rule as misleading.
Before the event, two marches were organised through several districts of Maharashtra and culminating in Pune with artists, activists, theatre performers and musicians among others. These marches held public meetings to rally support for Dalit victims of atrocities and collect donations for the Elgar Parishad.


== Event ==
The event began at 2 PM under six tents pitched in front of the Shaniwarwada Fort. After the tents filled up at 2.30, police refused to let more people in, fearing stampede. The stage seated the organisers and speakers of the event, including Gujarat MLA Jignesh Mevani, Dalit activist Radhika Vemula, Adivasi activist Soni Sori, Vanchit Bahujan Aaghadi leader Prakash Ambedkar, Bhim Army President Vinay Ratan Singh, retired Bombay High Court Justice BG Kholse-Patil, and student leader Umar Khalid.
A number of cultural performances with anti-caste themes were staged. Shahirs performed songs in tribute of Sant Tukaram, Mahatma Jyotirao Phule, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj. A dance troupe performed acrobatics and hip-hop groups also performed. Before Radhika Vemula made her speech, she was invited to smash a stack of pots signifying the varna system in a symbolic gesture of annihilating caste.


== Aftermath ==
On 1 January 2018, violence broke out at Bhima Koregaon, where lakhs of  Hindu Dalits minorities like Buddhist had converged to commemorate the battle. One person was killed, and three others injured.
In the months following the event, a number of people present at the event were arrested under laws such as the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA). This included Surendra Gadling, Rona Wilson, Mahesh Raut, Sudhir Dhawale, Shoma Sen and Stan Swamy. Pune Police alleged that the event was sponsored by Maoists. An FIR was filed against Jignesh Mevani for promoting enmity on grounds of religion.
It was alleged by the Pune Police that the event was organised by members of the banned Communist Party of India (Maoist). They said that it instigated violence at Bhima Koregaon. However, Justices BG Kolse-Patil and PB Sawant refuted their claims. The Justices said that it was the two of them who were the main organisers and sole funders of the event, and that they had held a similar event against communalism and Hindutva in October 2015 at the same venue.

ERA-GLONASS is the modern Russian system of emergency response, similar to the European standard eCall/E112. The system is designed for use with the Russian global satellite navigation system GLONASS on behalf of the Government of the Russian Federation.

Since 2001, authorities have implemented project E911, which tries to automatically associate a location with the origin of calls to 9-1-1 emergency services. In 2006, the Next Generation 9-1-1 (NG 9-1-1) initiative was introduced. The purpose of the initiative is to afford any emergency caller the opportunity to use any communication means for connection to the emergency services operator, which in turn can receive location data from fixed and mobile phones, as well as automatic sensor-activated devices in case of accidents. In 2010, the system was tested and has become widely implemented.


== European Union ==
In 2001, countries within the European Union implemented the eCall program. eCall is an initiative to bring rapid assistance to motorists involved in collisions and is not designed to allow vehicle tracking outside of emergencies. Some European countries equip trucks with similar devices, containing navigational and communication components. In 2005, Germany began installing eCall devices on trucks with a carrying capacity exceeding 12 tonnes. Trucks in Sweden greater than 3.5 tonnes install the automatic connection devices. The European Commission proposals for legislative acts predicted eCall would be seamlessly functioning in most European vehicles by end of 2015. The deadlines for implementation will most likely be delayed to the end of 2017 or early 2018, as the adoption procedure of these legislative acts by the European Parliament and the Council is not complete.
An eCall equipped car transmits a 1-1-2 emergency call through the Private GSM frequency, to the closest radio tower, to ensure the signal is sent to the appropriate PSAP, as fast as possible. If none of the passengers involved in the collision are able to speak, a minimum data set is sent, including the coordinates of the vehicle.
Since 2018, European Union is a member of the UNECE regulation 144 related to accident emergency call components (AECC), accident emergency call devices(AECD) and accident emergency call systems (AECS).


== Kazakhstan ==
Kazakhstan has developed an analog system ERA GLONASS called ""EVAK"" – an emergency call in case of emergencies and disasters. It operates using signals from navigation satellite systems GLONASS and GPS. It is expected in 2016 to equip the system board passenger vehicles weighing over 2.5 tonnes, buses, trucks and special vehicles for the transport of dangerous goods, and in 2017 – all other vehicles.

== Plot ==
In the Nineteenth Year of Kannei (1642), a rebellion by the Hori clan against Katō Akinari, the daimyō of Aizu, has been suppressed through the intervention of the Tokugawa shogunate. Placed into the custody of the Seven Spears, Katō's brutal group of personal enforcers, the Hori men are dragged to the Tōkei-ji ""Divorce Temple"" at Kamakura where the Hori women had been hiding. Despite a law passed by the former shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu forbidding men to enter the temple, the Seven Spears force their way in and brutally slaughter the Hori women in front of their husbands and brothers, before proceeding to murder them too. The massacre is stopped only by the intervention of Princess Sen, the Tōkei-ji Temple's guardian and older sister to the reigning shogun Tokugawa Iemitsu. When the Seven Spears agree to depart, only seven of the Hori women are left alive.
In retribution for the violation of Tōkeiji Temple and those who she had taken under her care, Princess Sen sends a message to the famous monk Takuan Sōhō. She asks him to locate a person who can train the seven Hori women in the arts of ninjutsu to seek their revenge. The one chosen is Yagyū Jūbei Mitsuyoshi, son of Yagyū Munenori and former instructor to the shogun. With Jubei's instruction and guidance, the Hori women begin their war against the Seven Spears and ultimately Katō himself.


== Characters ==
Yagyū Jūbei Mitsuyoshi (柳生 十兵衛 三厳) - Son of the famous Yagyū Munenori, Jūbei was formerly a sword instructor for Shogun Iemitsu but gave up the post to his younger brother in order to live as a wandering swordsman. Chosen by Takuan Sōhō at the request of Princess Sen to train the Hori women in the arts of war, Jūbei had strong doubts as to whether they would be able to win but agreed to teach them as it might prove interesting. As the Seven Spears greatly outclass the Hori women in terms of power and martial ability, Jūbei instead instructs them in the ways of military strategy, devising ambush tactics for the Hori women to eliminate the Seven Spears one by one in ways that neutralize their individual skills. Although a harsh and merciless teacher (Takuan relates to Princess Sen how during one of his lessons with Iemitsu Jūbei beat his student to the point that Iemitsu couldn't even stand), Jūbei has a mischievous streak to him and he enjoys needling and annoying the Hori women while his cavalier attitude belies both his strong sense of justice and his dedication to his students.


=== The Hori Clan ===
Hori Mondo Tsunafusa (堀 主水, Hori Mondo) - Lord of the Hori Clan and former samurai to Aizu daimyō Katō Akinari. Despite his disgust at the wanton acts of violence and depravity performed by his lord, Mondo performed his required duty as Katō's Kuni-Garo (chief vassal) until he was pressured to surrender his daughter Ochie to be Katō's mistress. Knowing that Katō would never accept his refusal, Mondo sent Ochie and the other Hori women into hiding at Tōkei-ji Temple while he and his men launched an assault on Katō's castle. Defeated by his soldiers, Mondo and his men fled to Koyasan where they posed as monks before being captured by Shogunate forces who turned them over to the Seven Spears. Mondo was then dragged in stocks to Tōkei-ji where he was forced to witness the slaughter of nearly all the Hori women before being taken back to Aizu where he and his men were brutally tortured to death.
Ochie (お千絵) - The daughter of Hori Mondo and princess to the Hori. Following the genocide of her clan, Ochie rises to take leadership of the survivors in their quest for revenge against Katō and the Seven Spears. Because of the abuse she and the others suffered at the hands of Katō and his subordinates, Ochie develops an aversion to all men and at first refuses to accept Jubei's help yet gradually comes to respect him as both a mentor and a comrade.
Ofue (お笛) - The attendant and confidante of Ochie, Ofue is the most easily distinguished of the Hori women due to her shorter, brown hair. The most outspoken of the Hori women, Ofue is easily riled which makes her a prime target for Jubei's teasing. She frequently serves as comic relief. Though she hates Jyubei at first, she gradually develops a large crush on him, which she reveals in the fourth volume of the manga, much to the amusement of the other Hori women.
Sakura (さくら) - The daughter of Mondo's brother Manabe Shobei and cousin to Ochie. Quiet and introspective, Sakura is sometimes assigned by Jūbei to spy on their enemies as her close-cropped hair allows her to disguise herself as either a woman or a young man.
Osawa (お沙和) - The wife of Mondo's brother Tagei Matahachiro and aunt to Ochie and Sakura. Osawa is a talented seamstress whom Jūbei assigns to create whatever costumes and disguises are required to spy or entrap their enemies. She serves as a mother figure to the other Hori women.
Oshina (お品) - The wife of Mondo's vassal Kanemaru Hansaku. Although dedicated to avenging her clan, Oshina is the most timid of the surviving women and rarely speaks.
Otori (お鳥) - The daughter of Mondo's vassal Itakura Buden. Despite her plump frame, she possesses both great agility and balance which aided her during her duel with Magobei.
Okei (お圭) - The wife of Mondo's vassal Inaba Jyuzaburo. When the Seven Spears start terrorizing Edo and kidnapping couples on their wedding night to lure out Jyubei, Okei and Jyubei disguise themselves as a recently married couple and allow themselves to be kidnapped by the Spears. They are taken to the Katō mansion, where they plan to take Lord Akinari hostage. The plan goes awry, and without the surprise intervention of Ochie, Ofue, and Sakura, who had followed them in secret, they both would have perished in the mansion. After the ordeal, the other Hori women begin to show jealousy toward her, thinking that Jyubei had begun to favor her ever since she played the role of his bride.


=== The Katō Clan and the Ashina ===
Katō Shikinobusho Akinari (加藤 明成, Katō Akinari) - The daimyo of Aizu and lord of the Katō clan (the historical Katō Akinari ruled Aizu between 1631 and 1643). Sadistic and perverse, Katō ruthlessly slaughters any who oppose him and spends his days fornicating with the constantly changing members of his harem. Although Katō's public face is of a fearless and powerful noble such as when he held his own against the attempted intimidation by Date Masamune (a bold man known as The One-Eyed Dragon); his private moments reveal him to be an insecure and apprehensive individual plagued by nightmares and constantly overshadowed by the legacy of his father.


==== The Ashina ====
A clan of ninja who once ruled over Aizu, the Ashina rescued Lord Katō seven years prior to the manga's beginning when he was attacked by an unknown assailant while out hawking. In gratitude, Katō selected seven of the strongest Ashina to be his personal bodyguards and enforcers, naming them the Seven Spears of Aizu after the historical Seven Spears of Shizugatake whom his father, Katō Yoshiaki, had led. The Ashina are as perverse as their Lord and whenever Katō grows bored with any of his consorts, the unlucky women are given to the Seven Spears who rape and torture them to death.

Ashina Dohaku (芦名 銅伯) - The primary villain of the second half of the series. Dohaku is Lord of the Ashina ninja clan and vassal to Katō. He trained the Seven Spears and holds the true power in Aizu, ruling from behind Katō's throne. He is 107 years old, the father of Oyura, and the twin brother of the High Priest Tenkai. His life is inextricably linked to that of his holy brother: if one is wounded the other will also feel pain; if one is killed, then the other one will die at the same time. But like Yakushiji Tenzen, the villain in Basilisk (Yamada/Segawa's previous work), Dohaku seems to be unkillable, and any attack to his body will heal in a matter of moments.  His ultimate goal is for the Ashina clan to obtain complete and legitimate dominion over Aizu by joining the Kato and Ashina houses through Lord Akinari's union with Oyura.  Dohaku plans to assassinate Akinari's son Akitomo so that Akinari and Oyura's child (Dohaku's grandchild) will become the new heir to Aizu's power. After dealing a death-blow to his own daughter while trying to kill Jūbei, Dohaku tries to destroy himself with the intention of also destroying his twin brother Tenkai, but Tenkai's determination to thwart Dohaku proves overpowering and Jūbei is able to strike Dohaku down.
Oyura (おゆら) - The daughter of Ashina Dohaku. Oyura is beautiful and seductive, and serves as Lord Akinari's main concubine in Aizu. She first appears in the sixth volume and the seventh one reveals her to be as cruel and sadistic as Katō, and delights in slaughtering many of the women kidnapped and imprisoned beneath Aizu castle. She and Katō are almost always seen being extremely intimate with one another regardless of where they are and who is present, including her own father who simply ignores their affairs while he discussed certain matters with the Seven Spears. However, after Jūbei's capture, she ultimately fell in love with him, to the point of taking a fatal blow from her father meant for Jūbei (though not realizing it would kill her).


===== The Seven Spears =====
Daidoji Tessai (大道寺 鉄斎) - The oldest of the seven spears, Tessai wields a two-handed scythe that can be split in half to form a kusarigama. The weapon also contains a weighted chain in the butt of the handle and a retractable secondary scythe blade in the head. Tessai is easily angered and will even lash out at his allies if he feels they've insulted him. Tessai often goes to the Yoshiwara brothel district to purchase women on his lord Akinari's behalf. In fact, a flashback in the first volume reveals that Tessai was the one who requested that Hori Mondo send his daughter (Ochie) to serve as Akinari's mistress. In response, Mondo rebuked Tessai, insulted Akinari, and later lead the doomed rebellion against his cruel lord, setting off the events of the story. Tessai dies at the hands of the Hori women, ambushed at dusk in the streets of Yoshiwara. After a short fight, the women trap and immobilize both ends of his chained weapon, then rush in from all sides to stab him with their blades. He is the first of the Spears to die.
Hiraga Magobei (平賀 孫兵衛) - Magobei stands out among the other Seven Spears due to his dark complexion. A specialist in long range combat, he wields a 20-foot (6.1 m) cavalry spear with the same speed and precision on foot as he would on horseback. In the second volume of the manga, Magobei accompanies Tessai to the Yoshiwara brothel district to purchase concubines for Lord Akinari. Disgusted by the brothel owner's smugness, he declares to Tessai that he will not return with him later to pick up the women. This decision may have saved his life—Tessai returns to Yoshiwara alone, where he is ambushed and killed by the Hori women. In the third volume of the manga Magobei pairs up with Gusoku Jyonoshin to confront Jyubei and Otoro at night in the streets outside Edo Castle. A canal divides the street between him and Jyubei, and so he strikes across the water with his spear. Jyubei swiftly traps the spearblade to the ground, disabling the weapon while Otori charges across the shaft, using it as a bridge to cross the canal and strike down Magobei. Magobei draws his wakizashi and slices through the shaft of his trapped spear, but instead of falling into the canal Otori springs into the air, catapulting herself above and inside his range of attack. Her blade slices him vertically from head to navel. He is the second of the Spears to die.
Gusoku Jyunoshin (具足 丈之進) - The weakest of the Seven Spears, Jyunoshin specializes neither in weapons nor hand-to-hand combat. Instead, he controls a pack of vicious dogs the size of calves whom he uses to hunt down and ultimately tear his opponents to pieces. His small size and overlong arms cause him to resemble a monkey, a fact the other Seven Spears frequently use to insult him. In the manga's third volume, Jyunoshin aides Magobei in a sneak assault on both Jūbei and Otori which ended in the death of both Magobei and two of Jyunoshin's dogs at the hands of Jubei, leaving Jyunoshin deeply traumatized and convinced that the Hori women's mysterious teacher was well beyond their ability to slay. Following the Hori women's infiltration of the Katō mansion in the fourth volume, Jyonoshin and Lord Akinari were captured and cast before Edo Castle's Takebashi Gate, where they were discovered by Princess Sen. The princess recognized them and, as punishment for their wickedness, had them marched through the streets of Edo like common criminals, exposing them to public ridicule. Following the incident, Lord Akinari went into a blind rage and promised to have Jyonoshin killed unless he uncovered the whereabouts of the Hori women. Using Tenmaru, his only surviving dog, Jyonoshin tracked the Hori women to Tokaiji temple. Shaving his head and posing as a priest, Jyonoshin managed to enter the temple where he discovered Ochie picking flowers in the temple grounds. Taking her by surprise, Jyonoshin gloatingly remarked that it had been he who had finished off Ochie's father Mondo in an attempt to goad her into attacking when Osawa, who had been hiding in a nearby tree, leaped down from the branches and drove her sword into Jyonoshin, pinning him to the ground. He is the third of the Spears to die.
Washinosu Rensuke (鷲ノ巣 廉助) - The most physically powerful of the Seven Spears, Rensuke is easily distinguished by his massive chin and sideburns. He disdains the use of weapons in favor of kenpō (Japanese martial arts inspired by Chinese martial arts) and his own inhuman strength. During the Seven Spears assault on Tōkei-ji, Rensuke was able to break open the temple's gate using his bare hands and feet. In the fourth volume of the series, while the Seven Spears are terrorizing Edo in Hannya masks, Jyubei tries (unsuccessfully) to pose as Rensuke in order to enter the Katō mansion. Koshichiro sees through his ruse and strikes at him, splitting the hannya mask to reveal not Rensuke, but Yagyū Jyubei (though through the darkness and rain he cannot recognize Jyubei's features.) Aside from Jyonoshin, Rensuke appears to have the most self-control of the Seven Spears, though his stems from his own intelligence, whereas Jyonoshi's is typically the result of cowardice. He is often called upon to hold Ginshiro back when the boy's tantrums threaten to become dangerous. In the sixth volume of the manga, Rensuke attempts to hunt down the Hori women and captures Otori and Oshina on the Aizu Echigo Road. He strips them of clothing and ties them to his body as a shield. As a result, Jūbei is prepared to offer his life for theirs when their monk companions from Tōkei-ji Temple take up their own swords and confront Rensuke. They drop the swords for the captive women as Rensuke kills them, allowing Otori and Oshina to seize the blades and sever Rensuke's legs. As he bleeds to death, Jūbei arrives on the scene, pinning Rensuke to the ground with his foot so the big man cannot struggle toward the women. Rensuke realizes Jūbei Yagyū was his true enemy, and he smiles as he dies, contented by the fact that ultimately he had been defeated not by women, but by the greatest and most famous swordsman in the world. He is the fourth of the Spears to die.
Shiba Ichiganbo (司馬 一眼坊) - A one-eyed pig of a man, Ichiganbo's bulk belies both his incredible martial ability and his cunning. Highly observant, he's usually the first to figure out crucial aspects that his comrades overlook and was the one who proposed framing Princess Sen in order to draw out Jubei. According to his plan, the Seven Spears would dress up in hannya masks and terrorize Edo, kidnapping betrothed couples on their wedding nights. The women would be brought to Akinari, and the men would be tortured and cast off in front of Edo Castle's Takebashi gate. In battle, he wields a whip that responds as though it were an extension of his own being. He can even use it to amputate parts of an opponent's body by wrapping it around their limbs or necks and pulling the whip taut. In the seventh volume of the manga, Ichiganbo leads a patrol of one dozen men into the wilderness of Northern Aizu to seek out the Hori women, who have infiltrated Lord Katō's territory. He is ambushed and killed by the Hori women, who had been concealing themselves in the fallen autumn leaves, stabbing him on all sides. Ochie finishes him off, splitting his head like a log with her blade. After his death, Ichiganbo's body is hidden inside a snowman outside Lord Katō's castle, where it is discovered on New Year's Day (Ashina Dohaku's birthday, incidentally) by Koshichiro and Ginshiro. He is the fifth of the Spears to die.
Koro Ginshiro (香炉 銀四郎) - The youngest of the Seven Spears, Ginshiro is cocky and impulsive. He is very feminine in appearance, but his otherwise beautiful features are marred by a thin, dark, scar that runs vertically down the middle of his face. He wields a net that when folded can easily be concealed within the palm of his hand yet when deployed can expand to envelop multiple people. The net possesses surprising strength despite its delicate appearance and its mesh is fine enough that not even air can pass through. Following Jubei's surprise raid on Katō's mansion, Ginshiro was the one who discovered that the Hori women had departed the convent. He also lusts after Sakura as during the murder of the Hori clan's female members he requests that the others allow him to slay her personally. Of all the Seven Spears, Ginshiro has the quickest temper and the least self-control. He is prone to sudden, violent rages, and often resorts to hissing, screaming, and insults when faced with a conflict. When Oyuri, under the influence of a powerful aphrodisiac, almost distracts Jūbei, he tries to use his net, but is wounded by Jubei before the net can land; when the net envelops the Hori women, Jūbei slices off the arm controlling the net. He is the sixth to die.
Urushido Koshichiro (漆戸 虹七郎) - The central member of the Seven Spears, Koshichiro is a master swordsman despite missing his left arm. In the first volume, he leads the massacre at the convent in Kamakura. Throughout the series, but more noticeably in later volumes, Koshichiro is portrayed as Jyubei's opposite among the enemy. He is bent on crossing blades with Jyubei, eager to determine once and for all which of them is the better swordsman. In the fourth volume, after being defeated in a brief encounter with the Seven Spears, Jyubei expresses doubt as to whether or not he would be able to defeat Koshichiro if they ever dueled. Koshichiro shows a peculiar mannerism when he kills, as shown in volumes 1, 9, and 11. Before engaging an opponent, he slips a flowering twig of cherry blossoms into his mouth (if one is available), and grips it in his teeth as he attacks. Though the manga does not specify a reason for this, there seems to be a poetic significance behind this quirk; falling cherry blossoms have traditionally been seen by samurai as a metaphor for death and the fragility of life. He is the last of the Seven Spears to die, finished off by Ochie and Ofue after having been granted his greatest wish by Jūbei to face him one-on-one.


=== Others ===
Tokugawa Iemitsu (徳川 家光) - The grandson of Tokugawa Ieyasu and the current reigning shogun. In the years between Basilisk and The Yagyū Ninja Scrolls, Iemitsu has grown from a somewhat dimwitted child into a capable and efficient ruler. Although he sympathizes with the Hori clan, his responsibilities as Shogun demand that he arrest them for the crime of rebellion and deliver them to Katō for punishment. As the Hori women had hidden in a divorce temple forbidding the entrance of men, Iemitsu was willing to spare at least them and was greatly troubled to hear that the Ashina were the ones charged with delivering the Hori to Aizu.
Nankoubou Tenkai (南光坊 天海) - The archbishop of Kanneiji temple. As with Ieyasu, Tenkai serves in Shogun Iemitsu's inner circle as his most trusted advisor. While he agrees with Iemitsu's decision to turn over the Hori men to Katō while leaving the Hori women sequestered in the divorce temple, Tenkai is all too aware of the Ashina clan's capacity for violence and the potential of the Seven Spears to escalate the already tenuous situation. He is the twin brother of Ashina Dohaku.
Yagyū Munenori (柳生 宗矩) - The father of Yagyū Jūbei and another former member of Tokugawa Ieyasu's inner circle. In the years between Basilisk and The Yagyū Ninja Scrolls, Munenori had been appointed sometsuke (the overseer of the daimyo) and since retired yet still holds a place in Iemitsu's council. Like Tenkai, he supports Iemitsu's decision to arrest the Hori men, stating that regardless of how justified their actions, allowing any sort of anarchy to go unpunished would jeorpardize the Tokugawa Shogunate's hold over the various regions.
Princess Sen (Tenjuin) (千姫 (天樹院), Sen-hime (Tenjuin)) - The granddaughter of Ieyasu and older sister to Shogun Iemitsu. As the guardian of Tōkei-ji Temple, Princess Sen was the one who convinced her grandfather to enact a law banning any man from entering. When Hori Mondo staged his rebellion against the Katō clan, Princess Sen agreed to grant shelter for the Hori women, disguising them as nuns but permitting them to keep their hair in the hopes that they would be able to leave once the matter had been settled. When the Seven Spears launched their attack, Princess Sen offered her life in exchange for the seven surviving Hori women and the Seven Spears retreated for fear that she would convince Iemitsu to have Mondo and his men released as well. Because both of her prior husbands died shortly after marrying her, a rumor spread throughout Edo stating that she seduced men only to kill them after having her way with them. Following the death of Magobei, the remaining Seven Spears took advantage of the rumor in order to draw out Jūbei by framing her for the kidnapping of several soon to be married couples throughout Edo.
Tenshuni (天秀尼, Tenshū'ni) - The high priestess of Tōkei-ji Temple and the granddaughter of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, Ieyasu's sworn rival. Following the Siege of Osaka in which the Toyotomi clan perished, Tenshuni was adopted by Princess Sen - whom Ieyasu had wed to Hideyoshi's son Hideyori as part of his political ambitions-and sequestered in Tōkei-ji. During the raid by the Seven Spears, Tenshuni was almost killed by Ginshiro who enveloped her in his net and nearly suffocated her before Ochie and the other Hori women revealed themselves. Although put off by Jubei's lack of grace, Tenshuni allows him to stay at Tōkei-ji to train the Hori women under the condition that he wear a set of bells to alert the other nuns to his presence. Jūbei would later repay the favor by having the Hori women wear bells while staying at Tokaiji.
Takuan Sōhō (沢庵 宗彭) - The High Priest of Shinagawa Banshozan Tokaiji Temple in Edo. Because of his friendships with various generals and swordsmen, Takuan was asked by Princess Sen to find a sensei who could train the surviving Hori women to defeat the Seven Spears. Later, as the Hori women begin their assault, he grants them and Jūbei shelter at his temple since the last place the Seven Spears would look for them would be a monastery forbidding women to enter.
Shoji Jinnemon (庄司 甚右衛門) - The owner of the Nishida-ya Brothel in Yoshiwara who frequently sells girls to Katō. In the past, Jinnemon was a bandit known as Shoji Jinnai who plundered the region of Kankatsu-sa as part of a trio of thieves known as the Three Jinnais. Although he learns of the way Katō abuses and eventually kills his consorts, he continues to sell women to him in exchange for higher costs to ensure his silence. After the Hori women kill Tessai who had been escorting the latest group of girls Katō had purchased, Jūbei assaults Jinnemon and forces him to provide money for the girls to escape, promising that he would return if Jinnemon ever sold another woman to the Katō clan.
Otone (おとね) - The 19-year-old daughter of Kamiya Goroemon (紙屋 五郎右衛門), owner of the Koga Lodgings. She first appears in sixth volume of the manga. During their stay at the Koga Lodgings, the Seven Spears become gravely concerned for their lord, who had grown paranoid to the point where he couldn't sleep and would often mutter to himself that Hori Mondo's ghost was haunting him (supposedly as retribution for slaughtering his clan). An irritated Ginshiro suggested to his fellow Spears that they find a woman to keep their lord company in hopes that it would help ease his paranoia. Otone was chosen for this purpose and is later kidnapped in her sleep by Ginshiro. The following morning, just before departing the lodge, the Spears presented Otone, bound up and terrified, to Katō who took an instant liking to her and incessantly violates her inside the palanquin throughout the trip. Otone was eventually rescued by Takuan, his followers and three of the Hori women who were disguised as priests at the time. Indebted to them for saving her, Otone joins the Hori women in their quest of vengeance against the Seven Spears.

Two-wheeler_insurance,Start,1,"Two-wheeler insurance is a type of insurance that is mandatory in India. Falling under the General insurance product category, it helps protect people against accidents that take place on the road. Active two wheeler insurance shields the vehicle owner from any unforeseen occurrences like the accident or any serious damage to the motor vehicle. A two-wheeler insurance policy is provided by any of the authorized insurance companies registered under the Insurance Regulatory Development Authority of India (IRDAI).


== Policy and benefits ==
The law binds anyone riding a two-wheeler with an insurance policy covering the owner of the vehicle against any unanticipated situations or accidents or the vehicle against damage. The vehicle is protected against any damage caused due to natural disasters such as storms, floods, landslides, earthquakes, and so on. In addition, it also covers against the damage caused by the theft, fire, accidents, riot, and explosion.


== Types ==
The motor insurance policy is generally categorized into ‘act only’ and ‘comprehensive’ policies. The former covers the death, physical injuries, or any damage to the property of the third party, the latter includes the coverage for the damage caused due to the external forces in addition to the third party damages.  However, the damage by external forces includes damages caused by fire, burglary, lightning, earthquake, cyclone, flood, terrorist acts, landslide, and so on.


== Buying ==
Generally, an insurance policy comes along with the new motor vehicle, wherein the cost of the policy is added up in the price of the vehicle. However, the validity of any two-wheeler insurance is one year and it has to be renewed every year either with the same company or the different company. Now insurance can also be bought online as offered by many companies like Shriram General Insurance, HDFC ERGO General Insurance Company, IFFCO TOKIO General Insurance, Digit Insurance, ICICI Lombard, New India Assurance & Reliance General Insurance. 
Many insurance companies make their presence online. The inspection of the vehicle is not undertaken and left to the risk of the insurance company.

Convolution_quotient,Start,1,"In mathematics, a space of convolution quotients is a field of fractions of a convolution  ring of functions: a convolution quotient is to the operation of convolution as a quotient of integers is to multiplication.  The construction of convolution quotients allows easy algebraic representation of the Dirac delta function, integral operator, and differential operator without having to deal directly with integral transforms, which are often subject to technical difficulties with respect to whether they converge.
Convolution quotients were introduced by Mikusiński (1949), and their theory is sometimes called Mikusiński's operational calculus.
The kind of convolution 
  
    
      
        (
        f
        ,
        g
        )

        ∗
        g
      
    
    {\textstyle (f,g)\mapsto f*g}
  
 with which this theory is concerned is defined by

  
    
      
        (
        f
        ∗
        g
        )

            x
          
        
        f
        (
        u
        )
        g
        (

        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle (f*g)(x)=\int _{0}^{x}f(u)g(x-u)\,du.}
  

It follows from the Titchmarsh convolution theorem that if the convolution

        f
        ,
        g
      
    
    {\textstyle f,g}
  
 is 0 everywhere on that interval. A consequence is that if

        g
        .
      
    
    {\textstyle f=g.}
  
 This fact makes it possible to define convolution quotients by saying that for two functions ƒ, g, the pair (ƒ, g) has the same convolution quotient as the pair (h * ƒ,h * g).
As with the construction of the rational numbers from the integers, the field of convolution quotients is a direct extension of the convolution ring from which it was built.  Every ""ordinary"" function

Non-function elements of our new space can be thought of as ""operators"", or generalized functions, whose algebraic action on functions is always well-defined even if they have no representation in ""ordinary"" function space.
If we start with convolution ring of positive half-line functions, the above construction is identical in behavior to the Laplace transform, and ordinary Laplace-space conversion charts can be used to map expressions involving non-function operators to ordinary functions (if they exist).  Yet, as mentioned above, the algebraic approach to the construction of the space bypasses the need to explicitly define the transform or its inverse, sidestepping a number of technically challenging convergence problems with the ""traditional"" integral transform construction.

Sigma_60-600mm_f/4.5-6.3_DG_OS_HSM_lens,Start,1,"The Sigma 60-600mm f/4.5-6.3 DG lens is a super-telephoto zoom lens produced by Sigma Corporation since 2018. It succeeds an earlier 10× zoom lens (50–500mm) which was introduced by Sigma in 2000 and is commonly known as the ""Bigma"". It is aimed at advanced consumers. The 60–600mm lens is produced in two versions: one exclusively for single lens reflex cameras, with Canon EF mount, Nikon F mount, and Sigma SA mount versions, named the 60–600mm F4.5-6.3 DG OS HSM | S, and one exclusively for mirrorless cameras, in Leica L-Mount and Sony E-mount versions, named the 60–600mm F4.5-6.3 DG DN OS | S.


== Versions ==

The acronyms used by Sigma designate the following features:

DG = digital-specific coatings
DN = mirrorless camera
OS = optical image stabilization
HSM = hypersonic motor
S = ""sports"" line
The SLR-specific version was released in 2018 and can be used with mirrorless cameras via adapters. According to Yasuhiro Ohsone, head of product planning at Sigma, it was developed as a successor to the company's earlier 50-500mm lens. The weight of the 60–600mm lens was reduced by 20% during its development with innovative materials: the mount and tripod attachment use magnesium alloy, the focusing and zoom rings use carbon fiber reinforced plastic, and the internal cams use thermally stable composite materials.
Sigma released a mirrorless-specific version in 2023. Compared to the older lens, the updated version has reduced weight and minimum focus distance, and increased focusing speed.

Helium_dating,Start,1,"Helium dating may refer to the traditional uranium–thorium dating (abbreviated U–Th/He dating) or to a variety of He diffusion methods that utilize the mobility of He atoms to determine the thermal history of a rock. Helium diffusion experiments are often used to help interpret information retrieved from U–Th/He thermochronometric experiments. Kinematic parameters derived from He diffusion is done through estimating He diffusion over a range of temperatures. The use of density functional theory  helps in estimating energy barriers for He to overcome as it diffuses across various crystallographic directions. Discrepancies, however, between observed and predicted He diffusion rates is still a problem and likely stem from unresolved problems in crystal defects and radiation damage in natural grains as opposed to theoretical grains. Depending on the mineral analyzed there are different assumptions to be made on He mobility. For example, He diffusion in minerals such as zircon, rutile, and monazite have been shown to be strongly anisotropic.
A relatively new dating method, tritium–helium dating has been developed for determining rates of oxygen utilization in the ocean.


== 4He/3He Thermochronometry ==
Traditional U–Th/He thermochronometry determines the temperature Tc that the analyzed sample had at a time in the past corresponding to the age given by its content of parent and daughter nuclides. More information, however, can be concluded about a mineral's thermal history if an analysis of the He distribution in-situ is performed. Similar to the argon–argon dating (which uses 40Ar and 39Ar isotopes) where 39Ar is a second non-radiogenically produced isotope derived from 39K, each step-heating release of 39Ar can be directly associated with a date. With Helium-3 (3He) production the 4He/3He evolution is interpreted to provide an intragranular Helium-4 (4He) distribution. This method is superior in two ways: diffusion kinetics for 4He can be precisely determined and the 4He distribution provides a continuous path in a time-temperature history s opposed to a single point in a bulk-grain date.
More specifically, the 4He distribution in a grain is a function of the time-integrated internal production from parent nuclides, minus diffusion loss and alpha ejection. This is done in conjunction with the assumption that the model is a spherical grain and calculations correlate with a radial position within that sphere. These calculations also assume that diffusion is isotropic.


== Use to support creationism ==
In 1997, the Institute of Creation Research began a research project, named ""RATE"" (Radioisotopes and the Age of The Earth), which aimed at determining the validity of scientifically accepted radiometric dating. One paper published from this research project describes the perceived issues of uniformitarian (U–Th)/He dating.
The assumptions made in the creationist arguments neglect the sensitivity that He diffusion methods have in regard to temperature fluctuations over time – especially since the granodiorite analyzed in the study has very complex geologic and thermal history.

Prudent_man_rule,Start,1,"The prudent man rule is based on common law stemming from the 1830 Massachusetts court formulation, Harvard College v. Amory The prudent man rule, written by Massachusetts Justice Samuel Putnam (1768-1853), directs trustees ""to observe how men of prudence, discretion and intelligence manage their own affairs, not in regard to speculation, but in regard to the permanent disposition of their funds, considering the probable income, as well as the probable safety of the capital to be invested.""
Under the prudent man rule, when the governing trust instrument is silent concerning the types of investments permitted, the fiduciary is required to invest trust assets as a ""prudent man"" would invest his own property with the following factors in mind: 

the needs of beneficiaries;
the need to preserve the estate (or corpus of the trust); and
the amount and regularity of income.
The application of these general principles depends on the type of account administered.  The prudent man rule continues to be the prevailing statute in a small number of states, in particular with regards to investments permitted by mutually-chartered institutions such as savings banks and insurance companies.


== Investment choices ==
The prudent man rule requires that each investment be judged on its own merits and that speculative or risky investments must be avoided. Under the prudent man rule, certain types of investments, such as second mortgages or new business ventures, are viewed as intrinsically speculative and therefore prohibited as fiduciary investments. As with any fiduciary relationship, margin accounts and short selling of uncovered securities are also prohibited.
In contrast with the modern Prudent Investor Rule, isolated investments in a portfolio may be imprudent on individual merits at the time of acquisition, however, as a part of a portfolio, the investment could be prudent. Thus, a fiduciary may not be held liable for a loss in one investment.


== Trend ==
Since the prudent man rule was last revised in 1959, numerous investment products have been introduced or have come into the mainstream. For example, in 1959, there were 155 mutual funds with nearly $16 billion in assets.  By year-end 2000, mutual funds had grown to 10,725, with $6.9 trillion in assets. In addition, investors have become more sophisticated and are more attuned to investments since the last revision of the Rule. As these two concepts converged, the prudent man rule became less relevant. This discounting of the relevance of the prudent man rule is more the result of market forces than it is of the needs of individuals for ""safety of capital"". The 10,000+ mutual funds of 2000 have grown to over 15,000 mutual funds in 2006.
The prudent man rule in its broader interpretations implies that the fiduciary should perform enough due diligence to ensure that the company meets the investment needs of the investors. Typical due diligence includes discussions with management, vendors and customers, as well as proper evaluation of any risk factors that might affect the performance of the company or its securities.
The modern interpretation of the ""prudent man rule"" goes beyond the assessment of each asset individually to include the concept of due diligence and diversification.  This is sometimes referred to as the ""Prudent Investor Rule"".  The logic is this:  an asset may be too risky to put all your money in (thus failing the prudent man rule) but may still be very diversifying and therefore beneficial in a small proportion of the total portfolio.

Wingfoot_Express,Start,1,"The Wingfoot Express was Walt Arfons and Tom Green's jet-powered land speed record car, driven by Green to a record on October 2, 1964, after Walt suffered a heart attack just prior. The Express was powered by a Westinghouse J46 engine and hit the 413 mph record mark.


== History ==
At a trade fair in Gary, Indiana in 1962, Arfons met Green, chief engineer for a torque wrench manufacturer. Although Green's only racing experience had been a year of stock car racing in New Mexico ten years previously, he was greatly interested in aerodynamics; this dovetailed perfectly with Arfons' interest in racing mechanics, and ""Within ten minutes we were planning our assault on the world's land speed record"" Green recalls.
Green shortly provided plans for a three-wheeled land speed record car, which had to be changed to four wheels to meet FIA rules; from there on there was little change until the car was finished. Green's emphasis was on reducing aerodynamic drag by lowering the drag coefficient and, especially, reducing frontal area by narrowing the track and using smaller wheels. His calculations indicated that the readily available surplus Westinghouse J46 jet engines would have more than enough power to drive the vehicle to over 400 miles per hour (640 km/h).
In order to find funding, Arfons and Green approached Goodyear, who were already funding Craig Breedlove's Spirit of America. In a presentation to 13 Goodyear executives Green emphasized his aerodynamic analyses, estimating that the wheel-driven Bluebird CN7 would be limited to 400 mph (640 km/h) and Nathan Ostich's revolutionary jet-powered Flying Caduceus to only 360 mph (580 km/h), but that their design should hit 480 mph (770 km/h), the target Breedlove was also going for. Although Spirit of America had a lower coefficient of drag, Green's design had a smaller frontal area and weighed slightly more than half as much. This, along with a thrust of 7,000 pounds force (31 kN) available from the J46 engine with afterburner, compared to only 4,400 pounds force (20 kN) available from Breedlove's J47 engine would make their design viable.
When the Flying Caduceus frustrated Ostich's team by refusing to go any faster than 355 miles per hour (571 km/h), Green's mastery of the subject was evident enough that Goodyear decided to fund his project in addition to Breedlove's; thus the name, Wingfoot Express, from Goodyear's trademark winged foot, inspired by a statue of Mercury. (In 1964 Bluebird CN7 demonstrated a final speed of over 440 mph, even when limited by poor surface conditions, invalidating Green's estimate.) However, although Spirit Of America had a $250,000 budget and Bluebird CN7 more than $2,000,000, Arfons and Green's car cost only $78,000.
Wingfoot Express' cockpit was located centrally, just behind the front axle, covered with an acrylic glass canopy from in front of the driver's feet to behind his head. The front wheels were mounted within the bodywork barely further apart than the width of the engine, while the rear wheels were on outriggers and exposed to the air. Green estimated that the aerodynamic drag of the exposed rear wheels cost the car 20 miles per hour (32 km/h), but since his calculations indicated that they already had much greater speed available than they needed, this was not viewed as a problem. A small fin rose vertically at the tip of the car's nose.
Veteran drag racer Arfons was to drive the car for the record attempt, but a month before the scheduled run, during initial testing on a dragstrip with Arfons outside the car observing, the two braking parachutes ripped loose and the car ""knifed through a chain link fence at 200 mph (320 km/h), ripped across a highway, jumped two four-foot (1.2 m) ditches and plunged 75 feet (23 m) into a wooded area. Only 300 feet (91 m) of fence that had become entangled in her rear wheels stopped her"", according to Green. Although the driver was unhurt ""when Walt saw the Wingfoot heading for oblivion he had a heart attack on the spot"" and was briefly hospitalized, but released himself in order to repair the car. In the process, he damaged the ligaments in one hand, eliminating whatever small chance remained of his driving the car for the record. At this point there was no time to find another driver, and Green, who had never driven over 130 miles per hour (210 km/h) in his life, was the logical choice because of his familiarity with the mechanics of the vehicle. At Bonneville, Green began his Land Speed Record career by easing the car around ""the parking area"" like any student driver. On his first timed run he hit 236 miles per hour (380 km/h), but ""I hadn't fully anticipated that I'd have the feeling of rattling and banging down the black line like a rock in a can...the salt was a little rough...."". ""at 250 mph [400 km/h] the upholstery of the seat hugged me like a pressure suit, at 275 [440 km/h] I had the weird feeling it was snowing in the cockpit!"" The ""snow"" was flakes of salt which were being sucked into the cockpit by the vagaries of the aerodynamics; aside from being distracting, this brought up fears that the air pressure might crack or even completely shatter or remove the cockpit at speed. At higher speed, the short front axle began to oscillate, necessitating an increase in the damping of the shock absorbers; but after that last modification, Green found that he could steer with one hand; ""I never drifted more than 8 feet [2.4 m] from the black line"". The first run using the afterburner sent the car well over 300 miles per hour (480 km/h); when it was shut down Green felt as if he had ""slammed on the brakes, but the airspeed indicator showed that I was still accelerating under regular engine power"". That run hit 335 miles per hour (539 km/h) before salt crystals drawn into the engine threw it off balance. Having only three days total booked at Bonneville, the team had to vacate for Craig Breedlove, who set the record at 400 miles per hour (640 km/h); leading to an intense debate within the FIA about what constituted a car, resulting in the unusual decision that Breedlove's three-wheeled jet vehicle was actually a motorcycle.
In 1964, Wingfoot Express returned to Bonneville for a week, but the engine never regained the strength shown in their earliest runs, and struggled to pick up speed. Even when another engine was installed, success eluded them. Finally, Walt's brother and longtime competitor Art Arfons, a brilliant intuitive mechanic for both piston and jet engines, suggested that the 17 inches (430 mm) opening of the ""clamshells"" on the engine exhaust was the problem. ""it was a 1/16 turn of the idle adjustment on the engine and opening of the afterburner clamshells to 19 inches (480 mm) that brought the engine up to record performance"", Green recalls. Green also removed some of the sheet metal around the engine intake, later realizing that in the process he had destroyed the Goodyear logo. But the Wingfoot Express now easily hit 299 miles per hour (481 km/h) with no afterburner. On the last day they had available, October 2, 1964, at 4:06 pm, a short blast of afterburner brought the car to a recorded 406 mph (653 km/h), but the official record required the run be ""backed up"" in the opposite direction. The lateness of the hour left no time for refueling, so the decision was made to save fuel by not making a full run over the entire distance for acceleration, and the car started the return run only 2 miles (3.2 km) away from the timing lights. Green and the car accelerated like a rocket, recording a remarkable speed of 420.07 miles per hour (676.04 km/h), thus averaging 413.20 miles per hour (664.98 km/h) in both directions and setting a new record not quite 2% faster than Breedlove's.
Within 3 days, however, the record had been reset by Art Arfons. Although the final record run had demonstrated that Wingfoot Express clearly had much more speed available, Green decided to not push his luck and retired from competition, returning to his regular job. He is today a vice president of the company, which used to produce torque wrenches for Snap-On. He continues to maintain contact with Arfons and they meet periodically. ""I did offer to help Walt with his rocket car but the design was his own"".
Walt Arfons went on alone to build Wingfoot Express 2 using solid-fuel rockets; peak power and acceleration was enormous, but could not be maintained long enough to set a record over the measured distance. Wingfoot Express 2 started with 10 JATO rocket bottles, and made an unofficial speed record of 605 mph with 25 JATO bottles in 1965.
Neither knows what happened to the original Wingfoot Express, or where it might now be.

Pro_Footvolley_Tour,Start,1,"The Pro Footvolley Tour is the preeminent touring series of professional footvolley in the Americas and the exclusive rights holder to Team USA.


== History ==
The Pro Footvolley Tour, started 2008,  with the first event held on Hollywood Beach, FL.  In that event, former FIFA World Cup winner and Brazilian star Romario won the competition playing alongside his partner Joao Luis. The first event was sanctioned under the United States Footvolley Association (the sport's governing body within the United States).
The Pro Footvolley Tour's initial event drew close to 5,000 spectators  The excitement led to a bigger and broader sponsorship package from both the host City of Hollywood and Bud Light for 2009. The following year, the tournament was held under a larger festival which also had a music concert. This event had international teams from France, Italy, Portugal, Brazil, and the United States, in the end, another Brazilian squad came away champions beating a Portuguese team led by Alan Cavalcanti before crowds of over 7,000 over 3 days. That success, prompted organizers to create Pro Footvolley Tour's 1st World Cup, in 2010. In 2011, Bud Light Lime stepped in as a national sponsor and the 'National Tour' was born. Over the next few years, more fans got to see the Pro Footvolley Tour as it went from simply a South Florida event to one with stops on both Coasts.  In 2012, the Tour debuted on GOLTV. In 2013 The tour  partner with Regional Sports Networks across the country. The exclusive relationships with RSN's brought the Tour into nearly all major markets in America, often with excellent time slots pre/post MLS Soccer Matches or MLB games, and with an enviable frequency of airings.


== Competition formula ==
The Pro Footvolley Tour altered some of the sport's traditional rules to make it more appealing to an American audience that covets faster and more aggressive sports.  The signature play in footvolley is the over-the-head frontal foot spike often referred to as the 'Shark Attack'.  Organizers noticed that this play - similar excitement level of an alley-op in basketball is deeded a bit risky thus the athletes preferred to try it only when matches were sort of decided already or if that was the only option left for an attacking player to attempt. The competition committee thus enacted a new 'super point' making a successful shark attack two points versus just one.  At first, players complained; but within a short period of time the sport noticeably became more athletic and more exciting. Teams are permitted three super points per set max; but may execute as many as they want to within a match.  Shark attacks completed after the three successful ones count then as only one point.
Another aspect of the game that changed was the lowering of the height of the net to 6'8"" and size of the court to 29'.5"" x 58'.  The rallies shorted a bit; but the action became faster with power becoming increasingly more important on offensive.
Tournaments generally begin with 16 or 12 teams with group play followed by straight elimination at the Quarter-finals stage.


== Appearance ==
United States men's national footvolley team and Brazil men's national footvolley team are the only teams that participated in all editions of the Pro Footvolley Tour.


== Celebrities ==
Footvolley has become a favorite side sport for some of soccer's biggest celebrities.  Pro Footvolley Tour hosted an event for Soccer Without Limits 'SWOL' in which top international stars such as Jérôme Boateng, Oguchi Onyewu, amongst others competed in an attempt to raise awareness against racism in football.

Domestic_tariff_area,Start,1,"Domestic Tariff Area (DTA) or Domestic Tariff Zone (DTZ) means an area within India that is outside the Special Economic Zones and EOU/EHTP/STP/BTP.
The units operating under certain specific schemes such as EPZ/SEZ/EOU are expected to carry out their activities within a customs bonded area. Any area which is not under the jurisdiction of a custom bonded area is called a Domestic Tariff Area.


== Procedure for the procurement from the domestic tariff area ==
Supplies from the DTA to a SEZ unit or developer without payment of central excise duty shall be on the cover of ARE-1, as is the case for normal exports out of India, i.e. under a bond or undertaking executed by the DTA supplier with the jurisdictional central excise officer.
A bill of export needs to be filed by the DTA supplier or the unit/developer on behalf of DTA to the authorized officer for assessment before the arrival of goods.
If the goods arrive before the bill of export is filed, they shall be kept in a place meant for keeping such goods and shall be released only after the assessment of the bill of export. 
A copy of ARE-1 and the bill of export need to be forwarded to the central excise officer having jurisdiction over the DTA within 45 days. 
The developer or unit can claim drawback or a duty entitlement pass book if the bill of export has been filed under it and if the unit or developer does not intend to claim, a disclaimer to this effect shall be given to the DTA supplier for claiming such benefits, provided the Duty Entitlement Pass Book DEPB scheme may be claimed by the DTA supplier.
The unit or developer may procure goods from the DTA without availing himself of exemptions, drawbacks and concessions on the basis of an invoice or transport document issued by the supplier.
A SEZ unit or developer may also procure:

Goods from international exhibitions held in India
Goods or services without payment of duty from an EOU/STP/BTP.
Goods or services from another unit located in the same or any other SEZ.


== Utilization of goods procured from DTA Unit ==
The goods declared into a SEZ shall be used by the Unit or the Developer only for carrying out the authorized operations. 
The goods can be utilized for purposes other than for the authorized operations or if the Unit or Developer fails to account for the goods as provided under these rules, duty shall be chargeable on such goods as if these goods have been cleared for home consumption. 
If the unit is unable to utilize the goods imported or procured from the Domestic Tariff Area, it may export the goods or sell the same to another Unit or to an Export-oriented industrialization Unit or Electronics Technology Park Unit or Software Technology Park Unit or Biotechnology Park Unit, without payment of duty, or dispose of the same in the Domestic Tariff Area on payment of applicable duties on the basis of an import license submitted by the Domestic Tariff Area buyer 
All documents for acceptance of goods into and out of a SEZ should be filed before the Authorized Officer of Customs.


== Sales in Domestic Tariff Area ==
A Unit can sell goods and services including rejects or wastes or scraps or remnants or broken diamonds or by-products arising during the manufacturing process or in connection therewith, in the Domestic Tariff Area on payment of Customs duties or Excise Duties, as the case may be.


== Procedure for Sale in Domestic Tariff Area ==
A SEZ Unit on behalf of Domestic Tariff Area buyer shall file a Bill of Entry for home consumption giving a complete description of the goods and/or services, along with an invoice and packing list with the Authorized Officers.


== Domestic Tariff Area removals ==
A Unit may remove capital goods to Domestic Tariff Area after use in a SEZ on payment of duty. 
Goods supplied by a Unit to Domestic Tariff Area on payment of duty may be brought back to the Unit for the purpose of repair within a period of six months from the date of clearance.


== Temporary Removals to Domestic Tariff Area ==
The Unit may temporarily remove the following goods to a Domestic Tariff Area without payment of duty: 

Capital goods and parts thereof for repairs and return;

Extendable-output_function,Start,1,"Extendable-output function (XOF) is an extension of the cryptographic hash that allows its output to be arbitrarily long. In particular, the sponge construction makes any sponge hash a natural XOF: the squeeze operation can be repeated, and the regular hash functions with a fixed-size result are obtained from a sponge mechanism by stopping the squeezing phase after obtaining the fixed number of bits).
The genesis of a XOF makes it collision, preimage and second preimage resistant. Technically, any XOF can be turned into a cryptographic hash by truncating the result to a fixed length (in practice, hashes and XOFs are defined differently for domain separation). The examples of XOF include the algorithms from the Keccak family: SHAKE128, SHAKE256, and a variant with higher efficiency, KangarooTwelve. 
XOFs are used as key derivation functions (KDFs), stream ciphers, mask generation functions.


== Related-output issues ==
By their nature, XOFs can produce related outputs (a longer result includes a shorter one as a prefix). The use of KDFs for key derivation can therefore cause related-output problems. As a ""naïve"" example, if the Triple DES keys are generated with a XOF, and there is a confusion in the implementation that causes some operations to be performed as 3TDEA (3x56 = 168-bit key), and some as 2TDEA (2x56 = 112 bit key), comparing the encryption results will lower the attack complexity to just 56 bits; similar problems can occur if hashes in the NIST SP 800-108 are naïvely replaced by the KDFs.

String_girdling_Earth,Start,1,"String girdling Earth is a mathematical puzzle with a counterintuitive solution. In a version of this puzzle, string is tightly wrapped around the equator of a perfectly spherical Earth. If the string should be raised 1 metre (3 ft 3 in) off the ground, all the way along the equator, how much longer would the string be?
Alternatively, 1 metre (3 ft 3 in) of string is spliced into the original string, and the extended string rearranged so that it is at a uniform height above the equator. The question that is then posed is whether the gap between string and Earth will allow the passage of a car, a cat or a thin knife blade.


== Solution ==

As the string must be raised all along the entire 40,000 km (25,000 mi) circumference, one might expect several kilometres of additional string. Surprisingly, the answer is 2π m or around 6.3 metres (21 ft).
In the second phrasing, considering that 1 metre (3 ft 3 in) is almost negligible compared with the 40,000 km (25,000 mi) circumference, the first response may be that the new position of the string will be no different from the original surface-hugging position. The answer is that a cat will easily pass through the gap, the size of which will be 1/2π  metres or about 16 cm (6.3 in).
Even more surprising is that the size of the sphere or circle around which the string is spanned is irrelevant, and may be anything from the size of an atom to the Milky Way — the result depends only on the amount it is raised. Moreover, as in the coin-rolling problem, the shape the string girdles need not be a circle: 2π times the offset is added when it is any simple polygon or closed curve which does not intersect itself. If the shape is complex, 2π times the offset, times the absolute value of its turning number must be added.
This diagram gives a visual analogue using a square: regardless of the size of the square, the added perimeter is the sum of the four blue arcs, a circle with the same radius as the offset.
More formally, let c  be the Earth's circumference, r  its radius, Δc  the added string length and Δr  the added radius. As a circle of radius R  has a circumference of 2πR ,

Top-attack,Start,1,"A top attack weapon is designed to attack armored vehicles from above, to take advantage of the fact that the armour is usually thinnest on the top of an armoured vehicle. The device may be delivered as a smart submunition or a primary munition by an anti-tank guided missile (ATGM), mortar bomb, artillery shell, or even an emplaced munition such as a mine. Top attack munitions use either a shaped charge warhead (often now tandem warheads in order to defeat ERA), or an explosively formed penetrator (EFP) warhead fired while over the target (usually by submunition).
The top attack concept was first put into service by the Swedish Armed Forces in 1988 with the Bofors RBS 56 BILL top-attack anti-tank missile.

Another method of top attack is the overfly top-attack (OTA or OFTA) where a missile with a vertically oriented shaped charge jet that fires downwards. A missile is directed to overfly the vehicle where a sensor detects the vehicle, and detonates the shape charge down into the top of the vehicle. This is system employed with the NLAW man-portable ATGM.

Maserati_8CL,Start,1,"The Maserati 8CL is an open-wheel Grand Prix motor racing car, designed, developed and built by Italian manufacturer Maserati, from 1940 through 1946. Only two models were produced.


== Racing and competitive history ==
Featuring a longer wheelbase, it succeeded the 8CTF. She was conceived to participate in the International Formula. The technical setting that gave positive results with the 4CL was resumed, namely four valves per cylinder, a square engine (i.e. the piston stroke was equal to the cylinder bore), and two compressors, one for each bank of 4 cylinders.
The outbreak of World War II shortly after its launch interrupted its development. The resumption of competitive activities after the conflict relegated supercharged racing cars, and with a large displacement, to free formulas, which however did not interest the public. This was also the fate of 8CL.
Two specimens were built, one before and one after the Second World War: the first was sold in Argentina, while the second was made specifically for the Scuderia Milano and achieved good results with Gigi Villoresi (third classified at the Indianapolis 500 in 1946). and Nino Farina (winner of the Mar del Plata Grand Prix in 1948).


== Design ==
The ignition was single with a Spark magnet. The distribution was with four valves per cylinder arranged in a 90° V, and a double overhead camshaft. Lubrication was forced with delivery and recovery pumps. The cooling system was water circulation with centrifugal pumps.
The engine was supercharged with two Roots-type compressors, one per bank, and two Memini carburetors upstream of the same. It had a displacement of 2,981.7 cc (181.95 cu in), with the bore and stroke both being 78 mm (3.1 in). It was an eight-cylinder in-line, having a compression ratio of 6.5: 1. The power delivered by the engine was between 415 and 430 hp at 6400-6800 rpm.
The brakes were drum brakes on the wheels with hydraulic control. The suspensions were with friction shock absorbers; the front ones were also equipped with torsion bars, while the rear ones were equipped with leaf springs. The steering was a worm screw and toothed sector, while the transmission consisted of a four-speed gearbox plus reverse.
The body design was open-wheel, covered in aluminum, while the chassis was made up of two side members with light-alloy cross members.
The model reached a maximum speed between 280–305 km/h (174–190 mph).

Script_Frenzy,Start,1,"Script Frenzy, also known as Screnzy , was an international screenwriting challenge where participants attempted to write a script (for the stage, screen, or other media) during the month of April.
The event was organized by The Office of Letters and Light, the nonprofit organization behind National Novel Writing Month (""NaNoWriMo"").  It ran each year from 2007 until 2012.


== Original format, and developments ==
The first Script Frenzy was held in June 2007 with a goal of 20,000 words to win. In 2008, Script Frenzy was moved to April and the goal was changed to 100 pages. The goals are roughly equivalent; the change simply reflects the fact that page count is a more standard measure of script length.
Other changes include the ability for writers to team up and work as two-person teams. The functionality was given to link both writers such that their page count would be shared.
Finally, in the original Script Frenzy only screenplays and stage plays were permitted. This has been expanded to include other types of scripts including TV series, graphic novels, shorts and audio plays amongst others. For the shorter formats, participants were allowed to submit several scripts to make up the 100-page total.


== Closure of the event ==
On June 26, 2012 it was announced that Script Frenzy was being closed down. The decision was made by the Office of Letters and Lights board after close consideration and a vote.  The event was cancelled due to a continued decline in participants, and likewise, a continued decline in donations.


== Statistics ==

To be crowned an official Script Frenzy winner, you must write a script (or multiple scripts) of at least 100 total pages and verify this tally on ScriptFrenzy.org.
You may write individually or in teams of two. Writer teams will have a 100-page total goal for their co-written script or scripts.
Script writing may begin no earlier than 12:00:01 AM on April 1 and must cease no later than 11:59:59 PM on April 30, local time.
You may write screenplays, stage plays, TV shows, short films, comic book and graphic novel scripts, adaptations of novels, or any other type of script your heart desires.
You must, at some point, have ridiculous amounts of fun.

Microburin,Start,1,"A microburin is a characteristic waste product from manufacture of lithic tools — sometimes confused with an authentic burin — which is characteristic of the Mesolithic, but which has been recorded from the end of the Upper Paleolithic until the Chalcolithic. This type of lithic artifact was first named by Henri Breuil who defined it as ""a type of angular, smooth, with a terminal retouch in the form of a small notch"". Breuil initially thought that the microburins had a functional use as a type of microlithic burin. However, he later came to realize that the manufacturing technique was different from that of the burin and that they could be waste products from the manufacture of microliths, but they may have occasionally been reused for a useful purpose, which is expected for parsimonious lithic resource exploitation 
A microburin is a fragment of a lithic flake, or more precisely, of a lithic blade, that shows on its upper face the beginnings of a notch terminating in an oblique flection (whose surface can only be seen from the lower side)  that  ends in a very acute trihedral apex. It was thought that microburins were exclusively a class of functional microliths, but knapping experiments, along with the refitting of contiguous pieces, have demonstrated that they are a characteristic waste product of an advanced lithic reduction process known as microburin technique - or more correctly, microburin blow technique, following a study of thousands of microburins originating from a variety of 
Saharan sites. Jacques Tixier noted that none of the examples studied showed unambiguous traces of intentional use, which also validates observation of lack of use wear from analysis of European pieces.
Examples found in Europe can be seen on this page : https://web.archive.org/web/20090131231751/http://archeobase.be/page_microburins_meso.html, which are associated with Mesolithic hunters of the Walloon region of Belgium (approximately 9,000 BP).
There is also a particular type of microburin named after Krukowski that is from a carving accident and not a waste byproduct.

Stardom_Cinderella_Summer_In_Tokyo,Start,1,"Stardom Cinderella Summer In Tokyo (スターダム シンデレラ東京の夏, Sutādamu Shinderera Tōkyō no natsu) was a professional wrestling event promoted by World Wonder Ring Stardom. It took place on July 26, 2020 in Tokyo, Japan, at the Korakuen Hall with a limited attendance due in part to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic at the time. The show aired on August 4, 2020 on tape delay.


== Production ==


=== Background ===
The show featured seven professional wrestling matches that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in the scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.


=== Event ===
Before the first match taking place, Stardom announced that roster member Itsuki Hoshino would retire due to bad health condition. Hanan and Ruaka's returns were also announced after the two spent much time recovering. The first match saw Saki Kashima picking a victory over Hina. The second match saw Natsuko Tora and Sumire Natsu picking a victory over Death Yama-san and Rina. Next, the Queen's Quest leader Momo Watanabe won her singles bout against the Future of Stardom Champion Maika. The fourth match saw Himeka and Syuri defeating the World of Stardom Champion Mayu Iwatani and Saya Iida. Syuri landed a challenge for the world title to Iwatani which the latter accepted. Next, the Queen's Quest's sub-team of Aphrodite, composed by Utami Hayashishita and Saya Kamitani succeeded in winning the vacant Goddesses of Stardom Championship after defeating Jungle Kyona and Konami.
In the main event, Giulia cashed in her 2020 Cinderella Tournament wish, which was to compete for the Wonder of Stardom Championship. But since the title was vacated by Arisa Hoshiki earlier on May 20 due to her retirement, a new opponent for Giulia was chosen, and that would be Tam Nakano. At the end of the night, the Donna Del Mondo leader succeeded in winning the title.

Car_ownership,Start,1,"Car ownership is the ownership of a car. Car ownership typically requires far fewer permits than driving that car on public roads (i.e. driver's license, car insurance, etc.).


== History ==
Levels of ownership have risen significantly since automobiles were pioneered in the 19th century. The United States was the first country in which mass ownership became common and 60% of families owned a car in 1929.  By the 21st century in the United States, there was, on average, a vehicle for every person of driving age and more vehicles than people with driving licenses. This level of ownership was so great that, in 2010, the total number of vehicles dropped significantly for the first time, falling by four million to 247 million.
Overall, across the world, levels of ownership increased fourfold between 1950 and 1999.


== Forms of ownership ==
A car is typically a major purchase and so there are a variety of financial schemes to facilitate the purchase. These include hire purchase, company cars, trade-in and leasing. Other forms of provision which centralise the ownership as a service include rental, car sharing and vehicle hire.


== Legal requirements ==
In some countries, there are additional regulations that must be fulfilled before purchasing or leasing a car.  For example, in Japan, due to the high population density and limited space, a prospective owner must first provide proof of a space to park the car in question (proof-of-parking).
In the Philippines and India, there is also interest in introducing proof-of-parking.
In Singapore, there are additional requirements in the form of Certificate of Entitlement which only allows the vehicle's owner to own the vehicle for 10 years. (Prospective) owners of heavy vehicles in Singapore must first provide proof of a space to park the heavy vehicle in question under the Vehicle Parking Certificate Scheme.


=== Consequences of legal requirements ===
In Japan, the proof-of-parking regulation, combined with high taxing, has caused a class of cars known as kei cars (kei jidōsha) to develop. These small cars, limited in dimension (3.40x1.48x2.00m length, width and height) and engine displacement (660 cc or 0.66 L) are popular due to tax discounts on the excise tax (3% instead of 5% for normal vehicles), the weight tax (30% cheaper), and the insurance cost is also more than 10% lower and the annual road tax, calculated on the engine size.


== Ownership documents ==


=== Title ===

In the United States, vehicle ownership is documented on a certificate of title. In the United States, each state's Department of Motor Vehicles or Registry of Motor Vehicles issues such documents when a vehicle is registered. Title deeds vary by design but always include vehicle-specific information at the front of the document (such as: year, make, model, VIN, color, etc.) and several boxes for transaction information at the back where information about change of ownership is recorded (such as sale date, odometer reading, seller and buyer names and signatures, etc.). In-state vehicle sales are recorded at the back of the title as long as there are unused reassignment boxes. If a vehicle is sold out-of-state, the new owner must apply for a new title at their local DMV office.
In Spain a second-hand vehicle ownership transfer is done at the DGT office or Tráfico as it's known locally. Transfer tax must be paid using a Modelo 620 form. This must be done within 30 days after signing the contract of sale for the vehicle and must be done by the buyer.  


=== MCO ===

In the United States, the Manufacturer’s Certificate of Origin (MCO), also known as Manufacturer's Statement of Origin (MSO) is the ownership document issued by the vehicle manufacturer that assigns ownership of a new vehicle to a franchise car dealership until said vehicle is registered and titled. This document is similar to the title deed in content, but is to be used among licensed car dealers only.


== Rates of car ownership ==

In the developed world, the number of cars per 100 people is generally between 30 and 50, with a few countries (such as Canada and New Zealand) over this. In China there are 15 cars per 100 people, and very poor countries such as Somalia have less than one car per thousand people.
In 2007, the expectation was that the rate of car ownership would be increasing almost everywhere, and rise very rapidly indeed in countries such as China and India. About ten years later, however, there is a trend from car ownership towards shared mobility, as countries try to reduce congestion and pollution caused by traffic in cities. For example, in Singapore, due to the Certificate of Entitlement quota system, the growth on the car population in the country has remained at zero percent since 2017. As the price of a Certificate of Entitlement fluctuates with market demand, the price of a Cat A certificate (for cars with engines of 1,600cc and below) hit a record high of S$106,000 (US$77,380) in October 2023. Additional taxes are also added to the car purchase price depending on the market value of the car when it was imported. This has resulted in Singapore being the most expensive place in the world to own a car, and has resulted in car ownership rates dropping to about 33% in 2023, a decrease from 40% in 2013.

One victim was as young as 9 years old; she was hospitalized and her condition was serious, but stable; the others ranged from onward to 17 age-wise; they were all accompanied together as siblings and their friends. They were selected at random, and had no known connection to the suspect. 
Jared Ravizza (born 1997/98) was arrested in Sandwich, Massachusetts, after a police chase that ended in a fiery car crash and the suspect being hospitalized for minor injuries. After a mental health evaluation, a doctor said the suspect has ""delusions, trouble focusing and voices in his head that tell him to do things"".


== Background ==
In April 2024, Ravizza's father called police claiming his son had attacked him. When officers showed up, Ravizza screamed at them, resisted arrest, and expressed belief in numerous conspiracy theories about various topics.
At the time of the attack, Ravizza was reportedly in the process of obtaining a legal name change to Jared Love Jones.
Ravizza is also being investigated in connection with the death of a Deep River, Connecticut man that same day.

J_Stevens,Start,1,"J Stevens is a Canadian cinematographer, director, writer and producer. They have directed episodes of Astrid & Lilly Save the World, Sort Of, Stories From My Gay Grandparents, and are a co-creator of the streaming television comedy series Slo Pitch. Stevens is one of the first openly non-binary filmmakers in the Directors Guild of Canada, and Playback Magazine named them one of the ""Top 10 Filmmakers to Watch"" in 2022.


== Biography ==
J Stevens (they/them) was born and raised in Calgary, and identifies as non-binary. They attended Strathcona-Tweedsmuir School, and were an active athlete, participating in track and field, tennis, golf, cross–country running, basketball and volleyball. They were named the school's athlete of the year in junior high school, and additionally, they were on the honour roll and a school prefect. Stevens said they always thought they were going to be a professional athlete. When Stevens was in grade 10, they became interested in filmmaking when they took a film studies class. Their class project was a ""one-minute, one-shot film about a blue dodge ball"". Stevens recalls while filming the short video that ""all of sudden it felt like all these different parts of my brain that had always worked in separate capacities just all worked as one"". After graduation from high school, they worked for a local TV station and then studied filmmaking at the British Columbia Institute of Technology.


== Career ==
They started out directing and editing corporate commercials, social media content, and also worked on multiple short films. After moving to Toronto, Stevens directed episodes of the teen drama television series Astrid & Lilly Save the World,  worked as a cinematographer for the short films Defund, Body So Fluorescent,  Hazy Little Thing and Adult Adoption. Stevens also directed an episode of the television sitcom Sort Of in 2022.
In 2020, they co-created the web television comedy series Slo Pitch with Gwenlyn Cumyn, and Karen Knox. They also serve as a director and executive producer of the series. Stevens, Knox and Cumyn hired people for the cast and crew ""who have traditionally been under-represented in the film and television industry"". The majority of the cast and crew for the series are BIPOC, and individuals who identify as female, non-binary and LGBTQ+. In 2024, they directed all 10 episodes of Stories From My Gay Grandparents, and also finished production of their feature film directorial debut, Really Happy Someday, which they co-wrote and produced.
In 2022, Playback Magazine named them one of the ""Top 10 Filmmakers to Watch"", and they are one of the first openly non-binary filmmakers in the Directors Guild of Canada. They also received an Outstanding Directorial Achievement nomination for a comedy series at the 2022 Directors Guild of Canada Awards for Astrid & Lilly Save the World.


== Personal life ==
In 2023, they founded the non-profit organization Spindle Films Foundation, which features a program that mentors transgender, non-binary, two-spirit and gender-diverse Canadian filmmakers. They are also a member of the Canadian Society of Cinematographers, serving on the Advocacy/Outreach/Education team.

Slovene_numerals,Start,1,"The names for numerals in Slovene are formed in a similar way to that found in other Slavic languages. An exception is the formation of numerals from 21 to 99, in which the unit is placed in front of the decade (""four-and-twenty""), as in German and Dutch. Many numerals alter their form according to grammatical case, and those from 1 to 4 also according to gender.


== Cardinal numbers ==


=== Units ===
The cardinal numbers 1 to 10 are: èn, dvá, tríje, štírje, pét, šést, sédem, ósem, devét, desét. The first four decline for gender, the rest do not. When counting or reciting numbers, the feminine form is normally used.
Èn declines as a regular adjective, with three genders èn, êna, êno and full case forms. There is also a longer form of the masculine nominative singular, êden, which is used when the numeral does not modify a noun directly. Èn has plural forms, which occur with nouns used only in the plural form (pluralia tantum), but no dual forms.
Dvá, tríje and štírje decline for gender, but are irregular. Dvá occurs only in the dual, tríje and štírje occur only in the plural.

The numbers from 5 onwards do not decline for gender. They also behave somewhat differently when modifying a noun. When placed in the nominative or accusative case, the following noun is put in the genitive plural case, while the numeral remains in the nominative/accusative. In the other cases, the numeral and noun are both in the same case.
All numerals from 5 to 99 decline the same, but the numbers 5 to 10 have changes in the stem when an ending is attached: šêst-, sêdm-, ôsm-, devêt-, desêt-. Pét is given here.


=== Decades ===
The numbers 11 to 19 are formed by suffixing -nájst to the base number: enájst, dvanájst, trinájst, štirinájst, petnájst, šestnájst, sedemnájst, osemnájst, devetnájst.
The decades 20 to 90 are formed by suffixing -deset to the base number (but 20 is irregular): dvájset, trídeset, štírideset, pétdeset, šéstdeset, sédemdeset, ósemdeset, devétdeset. When combined with a unit, the order of unit and decade is reversed, unlike in most Slavic languages, but like in German. The unit comes first in the feminine form, then the decade, joined together by in 'and', and both elements retain their individual accents: ênaindvájset, dváindvájset, tríindvájset, štíriindvájset, etc.
All decades decline like pét above.


=== Hundreds ===
100 is stó, and declines as pét, but has the stem stôt- when an ending is attached. Multiples of 100 are formed like the decades, by suffixing -sto to the base number in the feminine form: dvésto, trísto, štíristo, pétsto, šéststo, etc. Enájststo 'eleven hundred', dvanájststo ""twelve hundred', and so on are used as alternatives to combinations using 'thousand' (see below), as in English.
Combinations of a hundred and a lower number are formed by placing the lower number after the hundred, as a separate word and in the feminine form: stó êna '101', stó dvé '102', ... stó desét '110', stó enájst '111', ... stó dvájset '120', stó ênaindvájset '121', ... devetsto devetindevetdeset '999'.


=== Thousands ===
1000 is tísoč, and behaves a masculine noun, with its own dual and plural forms. Multiples of 1000 are formed like a numeral modifying any other noun, but tísoč itself does not decline according to the preceding number: dvá tísoč, trí tísoč, štíri tísoč, pét tísoč etc.
Combinations of a thousand and a lower number are formed as they are with hundreds: tísoč êna (1001), ... tísoč stó (1100), ... pét tísoč pétsto pétinpétdeset (5555), ... devétsto devétindevétdeset tísoč devétsto devétindevétdeset (999,999).


=== Millions and above ===
Slovene uses the long scale: milijón (1,000,000), milijárda (1,000,000,000), bilijón (1,000,000,000,000), bilijárda (1,000,000,000,000,000) and so on. These are nouns with distinct genders, alternating masculine and feminine; milijón is masculine, milijárda is feminine, etc.
Multiples and combinations are formed the same as the thousands. However, the nouns for the millions themselves decline for number as well, and are placed in the genitive plural case following numbers that require this: dvá milijóna (2 million), dvá milijóna êna (2,000,001), ... tríje milijóni (3,000,000), ... sédem milijónov petnájst tísoč sédemindvájset (7,015,027), ... devétsto devétindevétdeset milijónov devétsto devétindevétdeset tísoč devétsto devétindevétdeset (999,999,999), ... dvé milijárdi (2,000,000,000), ... trí milijárde (3,000,000,000).


== Ordinal numbers ==
The ordinal numbers are regular adjectives in Slovene. They have only definite forms, so the masculine nominative singular ends in -i. In writing, ordinals may be written in digit form followed by a period, as in German: 1., 2., 3., 4. and so on.
The ordinals from 1st to 4th are formed irregularly: pŕvi, drúgi, trétji, četŕti.
From 5th to 99th, ordinals are formed simply by declining the corresponding cardinal number as a regular adjective. If the last syllable is stressed, a closed long e or o becomes open. Thus: pêti/pêta/pêto (5th), šêsti/šêsta/šêsto (6th), sêdmi/sêdma/sêdmo (7th), ... devétindevétdeseti/a/o (99th). 100th and 1000th are formed the same way: stôti/a/o, tísoči/a/o. For the millions and above, -ti is suffixed and the vowels are not changed: milijónti/a/o (millionth), milijárdti/a/o (billionth).
In ordinals from 100th and above, if the number is formed by multiple words, only the last word is changed into an ordinal. The others remain the same as the cardinal. So 200th is dvéstoti, but 201st is dvésto pŕvi.


== Adverbial numbers ==
Adverbial numbers indicate a repetition, and come in two forms, corresponding to the cardinal and ordinal numbers.
The cardinal adverbials are formed by suffixing -krat to a cardinal number: ênkrat (once), dvákrat (twice), tríkrat (thrice/three times), štírikrat (four times), petkrat (five times) and so forth. For example: Osel gre samo enkrat na led. (""A donkey goes onto ice only once"", equivalent to ""Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me."")
The ordinal adverbials are formed by suffixing -č  or -krat to the masculine nominative singular form of an ordinal number: pŕvič/pŕvikrat (first time), drúgič/drúgikrat (second time), trétjič/trétjikrat (third time), četŕtič/četŕtikrat (fourth time), pêtič/pêtikrat (fifth time) and so forth. For example: Ko drugič poskusiš, uvidiš, da že kar znaš. (""When you try it the second time around, you realize that you already know it quite well."")


== Collective numbers ==

Collective numbers are used for plural mass nouns, as well as to emphasise diversity of what is counted. Those from 2 to 5 are: dvoje, troje, četvero, petero: for example, dvoje oči, dvoje vrat, troje ljudi (two eyes, two doors, three people).


== Multiplicative numbers ==

Multiplicative numbers are adjectives that denote a certain multiplication of something, similar to suffixing -fold in English. They are formed in two possible ways, with more or less the same meaning:

enójen, dvójen, trójen, četvóren, petórno (single, double, triple, quadruple, fivefold/quintuple) – used to name the number of parts (dvojni ulomek (double fraction))
enkraten, dvakraten, trikraten, štirikraten, petkraten (essentially the same meaning, but less often used)

Bulk_material_analyzer,Start,1,"The term bulk material analyzer is the generic noun for that device which fits around a conveyor belt and conducts real-time elemental analysis of the material on the belt.  Other names often found for such a device include belt analyzer, crossbelt analyzer and elemental analyzer. This product first found popularity in the cement industry during the 1990s, and today most new cement plants include at least one analyzer, if not two.


== Cement industry ==
A couple of applications predominate for the bulk material analyzer in cement production.


=== Stockpile management ===
One is known as ""stockpile management,"" whereby an analyzer located upstream of the pile is able to track the cumulative chemistry of the pile.  This allows the operator to direct haul trucks to different sections of the quarry in a way that will result in the final elemental composition of the pile close to target.


=== Raw mix proportioning ===
A second application in cement for the bulk material analyzer is raw mix proportioning.  An analyzer placed just upstream of the raw mill can monitor the chemistry of the raw mix and automatically trigger an adjustment in the proportions of the reclaimed stockpile and the correctives.  By doing so, the plant is able to reduce the variability in the raw mix, and later on the kiln feed.  Consistent kiln feed chemistry in turn leads to lower fuel consumption per ton of clinker produced.


== Other applications ==
In the 2000s the application of the bulk material analyzer was extended to include minerals.  Today, analyzers are found in copper, iron ore, and phosphates, to name a few.  One of the advantages of these analyzers is the timeliness of information for the user.  Another is the avoidance of physical sampling.


== Technology ==
The technology most frequently found in bulk material analysis and coal analysis are PFTNA (Pulsed Fast Thermal Neutron Activation), the prompt gamma neutron activation analysis (PGNAA) and Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS).
PFTNA and PGNAA technology rely on activation of the material on the conveyor belt by neutrons, and the instantaneous emission of gamma rays from nuclei which have absorbed neutrons.  Capitalizing on the unique gamma ray spectrum associated with each element, the instrument can perform an analysis each minute on the composite spectrum to determine the overall elemental composition of the material.
LIBS operate by focusing the laser onto a small area at the surface of the material forming a plasma plume. When plasma quickly cools down the atomic emission lines of the elements can be observed using optical spectrometer. Based on obtained spectra quantitative chemical analysis of the sample is performed.

Bucket_elevator,Start,1,"A bucket elevator, also called a grain leg,  is a mechanism for hauling flowable bulk materials (most often grain or fertilizer) vertically.
It consists of:

Buckets to contain the material;
A belt to carry the buckets and transmit the pull;
Means to drive the belt;
Accessories for loading the buckets or picking up the material, for receiving the discharged material, for maintaining the belt tension and for enclosing and protecting the elevator.
A bucket elevator can elevate a variety of bulk materials from light to heavy and from fine to large lumps.
A centrifugal discharge elevator may be vertical or inclined. Vertical elevators depend entirely on centrifugal force to get the material into the discharge chute, and so must be run at a relatively high speed. Inclined elevators with buckets spaced apart or set close together may have the discharge chute set partly under the head pulley. Since they do not depend entirely on centrifugal force to put the material into the chute, their speed may be slower.
Nearly all centrifugal discharge elevators have spaced buckets with rounded bottoms. They pick up their load from a boot, a pit, or a pile of material at the foot pulley.
The buckets can be also triangular in cross-section and set close together on the belt with little or no clearance between them. This is a continuous bucket elevator. Its main use is to carry difficult materials at a slow speed.
Early bucket elevators used a flat chain with small, steel buckets attached every few inches. While some elevators are still manufactured with a chain and steel buckets, most current bucket elevators use a rubber belt with plastic buckets. Pulleys several feet in diameter are used at the top and bottom. The top pulley is driven by an electric motor.
The bucket elevator is the enabling technology that permitted the construction of grain elevators. A diverter at the top of the elevator allows the grain to be sent to the chosen bin.
A similar device with flat steps is occasionally used as an elevator for humans, e.g. for employees in parking garages. (This sort of elevator is generally considered too dangerous for use by the public.)


== Bucket elevator styles ==
There are three common bucket elevator designs seen in bulk material handling facilities worldwide:

Centrifugal Discharge Elevator – This is the typical style of elevator used in many grain handling facilities. The elevator buckets discharge the grain freely, using centrifugal force. The grain is flung out of the bucket into the discharge spout at the top of the elevator. The most common style of agricultural elevator bucket is the ""CC"" style. This style can be recognized by the four breaks in the inside bottom of the bucket, straight sides, and the presence of high sides or ""ears"".
Continuous Discharge Elevator – This style of bucket elevator is used typically to discharge sluggish and non-free flowing materials; the elevator buckets discharge on top of each other. To achieve the required centrifugal force, a speed of around 6 metres (20 feet) per second is used. Common styles of elevator buckets used are the MF, HF, LF, and HFO due to their ""V"" style, among other attributes.
Positive Discharge Elevator – Buckets are used to elevate delicate products such as popcorn, candy and potato chips (British: crisps), for which gentle handling is very important. This style elevator bucket operates off a double strand chain; the buckets are held in place by two pins so that they can swivel freely. To discharge the bucket, it is mechanically flipped, but until then the bucket is held parallel to the floor and upright. These elevators typically form an ""S"" or ""L"" in design and run throughout a plant.

Skyland_İstanbul,Start,1,"Skyland İstanbul is a prominent mixed-use complex located in the Huzur neighborhood of the Sarıyer district in Istanbul, Turkey. The complex consists of the Skyland Residence Tower (284 m / 65 floors), Skyland Office Tower (284 m / 64 floors), and the shorter Skyland Hotel Tower (180 m / 28 floors). The innovative designs were conceptualized by Peter Vaughan of Broadway Malyan.
In 2023, the Skyland Residence and Skyland Office towers rank as the third and fourth tallest skyscrapers in Istanbul, standing at a commanding height of 284 m (932 ft). They are surpassed in height by the 352 m (1,154 ft 10 in) Turkish Central Bank Tower in the Ataşehir district, and the Metropol Istanbul Tower A which rises to 301 metres inclusive of its dual spires.
Initiated in 2012, the Skyland İstanbul project, with a substantial investment of US$700 million, showcases 830 luxurious residences, 504 state-of-the-art office spaces, and a five-star international hotel encompassing 300 rooms and a grand conference hall with a 550-seat capacity.


== History ==
The conceptualization of Skyland İstanbul can be traced back to the late 2000s, when Istanbul's growing influence as an international business and tourism hub necessitated the development of state-of-the-art architectural marvels. Conceived as a symbol of modernity and progress, the project saw its groundbreaking in 2012 following collaboration with international architectural firms.


== Architecture ==
Designed by Peter Vaughan of Broadway Malyan, the towers showcase a fusion of Istanbul's rich heritage and contemporary design elements. The façade, made of reflective glass, is meant to mirror the city's vibrant energy, while the interior design reflects traditional Turkish motifs reimagined for the 21st century.


== Facilities and Amenities ==
Skyland İstanbul's facilities include:

Residential Towers: Apart from standard amenities, residents enjoy access to an exclusive sky lounge, providing panoramic views of Istanbul.
Office Tower: Emphasizing sustainable business practices, the offices are eco-friendly with green terraces.
Hotel Tower: The hotel merges Turkish hospitality with modern luxury, offering themed suites that pay homage to various epochs of Turkish history.


== Economic Impact ==
The $700 million investment in Skyland İstanbul revitalized the local economy, attracting both domestic and international investors. Its construction generated thousands of jobs and, post-completion, it has become a hub for international conferences and summits, further bolstering Istanbul's status as a global city.


== In Popular Culture ==

Aside from its architectural significance, Skyland İstanbul has also graced the silver screen. It was notably the setting for a key scene in the blockbuster movie ""Eurasian Heist.""

Amaymon,Start,1,"In demonology, Amaymon (also Amaimon, or Amoymon) is a prince of Hell, and, according to some grimoires, the only one who has power over Asmodai.
A curious characteristic of this spirit is alleged in almost all copies of the Ars Goetia in English, that during the evocation of Asmodai to visible appearance, the exorcist must stand upright with his cap or headdress removed in a show of respect, because if he does not do so, then Amaymon will deceive him and doom all of his work. According to Joseph H. Peterson, editor of ""The Lesser Key of Solomon"" (Weiser 2001) this is a ""bizarre translation of 'si vero coopertus fuerit'"" (Page 21 Footnote 57) by Scot in his ""Discoverie of Witchcraft"" which contains a translation by Scot of Pseudomonarchia Daemonum by Johannes Weyer. Peterson's edition includes as an appendix, a copy of Weyer's Pseudomonarchia Daemonum in the original Latin where we find (Page 242) ""Cum hujus officia exercet exorcista, fit fortis, cautus & in pedibus stans: si vero coopertus fuerit, ut in omnibus detegatur, efficiet: Quod si non fecerit exorcista, ab Amaymone in cunctis decipietur"" which translates to ""When the exorcist performs his offices, he should be strong, cautious and standing on his feet: if he will be truly overwhelmed he will bring it about that in all things he is unprotected: But if the exorcist does not, by Amaymon he will be deceived in whole.""
In the original text by Johannes Weyer, there is nothing about taking off caps or headdresses when evoking Asmodeus. The curious characteristic replicated in every known English text of the Ars Goetia seems to arise from laziness on the part of Scot and generations of scribes replicating the English text without checking the original Latin.
Amaymon is said to have a deadly poisonous breath. The Lesser Key of Solomon states that the exorcist or conjurer must be in possession of a silver ring, that is duly consecrated and worn on the middle finger, as a form of protection against this poisonous astral breath.
According to Pseudomonarchia Daemonum and The Lesser Key of Solomon, Amaymon is the king of the east, while in the Liber Officiorum Spirituum and the 18th century grimoire Clavis Inferni he is stated to be the king of the south.
In The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage, translated by S.L. MacGregor Mathers, Amaymon (as Amaimon) is still the king of the south and also one of the eight sub-princes, described as an Egyptian devil, who Abramelin restrained from working evil from the third hour until noon and from the ninth hour until evening.

Pitch_pipe,Start,1,"A pitch pipe is a small device used to provide a pitch reference for musicians. Although it may be described as a musical instrument, it is not typically used to play music as such. 


== Origins ==

The earliest pitch pipes were instruments similar to the recorder, but rather than finger holes, they had a plunger like a slide whistle's (also known as a swanee whistle) making it essentially a type of Slide Whistle. The pipe was generally made of wood with a square bore, and the plunger was leather-coated. On this plunger are marked the notes of either the chromatic scale or the diatonic scale, and by setting it to the correct position, the indicated note will be produced when the instrument is blown. Pitch pipes come in all sorts of shapes and sizes.
Pitch pipes of this sort were most often used in the 18th and 19th centuries in churches which had no organ to give the opening note of a hymn. They are now quite rare, and hardly ever used for what they were intended for, but may still be used as an alternative to a tuning fork. They are also useful for establishing what pitch standard was being used at a particular place and time.


== Modern pitch pipes ==
Although few look like a pipe, the pitch pipe name is still applied to any device used as a pitch reference. The most common type is a circular free reed aerophone. These are discs with the holes for the reeds around the perimeter and with marked openings for each note, into which the user blows. Inside the pipe, the air flows through a hole in a plate past the selected rectangular metal reed (usually brass).  The airflow is modulated by the oscillating reed, then it resonates in an outer sounding chamber. In recent years, electronic push-button devices simulating chromatic pitch pipes have become available which are small enough to fit on key chains.


== Usage ==
Some pitch pipes are intended for tuning string instruments, and only provide reeds for notes appropriate to a particular instrument. Chromatic pitch pipes are favored by a cappella singers and timpanists. Chromatic pipes most often provide thirteen pitches, each a half step above the previous. By providing all of the notes of a single octave, a singer can start in any key called for in Western music. Different pipes are available for bass and treble voices due to variations in vocal range. Most male and female performers prefer to use F-F pipes and C-C pipes, respectively. However, it is particularly notable that the Men's pipe in F is pitched higher than the Women's C pipe. Pipes in other keys are available, but are much more rare.
The singers' normal use of the pipe is to play the initial key note or tonic of the piece to be sung.  Less frequently the pipe will be used to play the first sung note of the song, especially where the song begins in unison or with a solo.
In Ethnomusicology, recording a short beep with pitch pipe in ethnographic recordings can be used in playback to determine the playback speed of the Gramophone record or Phonograph cylinder.


== Problems ==
The brass reeds in common pitchpipes are subject to work hardening with use, so they gradually change pitch.  Because of this, replacement reed plates are sold.  Carried in a pocket, a pipe will occasionally pick up small bits of lint which works its way into the narrow space around a reed.  This usually requires disassembly of the pipe in order to clean the lint off the reed.  To avoid this eventuality many users will use a small holster to carry the pipe.

Malay_kite,Start,1,"The Malay kite is a model of tailless kite. First introduced to the West in a New York City newspaper article from October 1894, the Malay kite was used for recreation for centuries before this in parts of the Far East. The article detailed how a university professor (""Clayton"") had erected a series of kites and bound them all together to one kite. These kites had no tail, were bowed and diamond-shaped, and were referred to by the article writer as ""Malay kites"". However, the existence of a Malay-like design may have already been heard of in the United States sometime before the publishing of the article; in the last edition of the American Boy's Handy Book, another tailless kite is described (there referred to as a ""Holland"" kite). The description of this kite, which was to be included as a chapter in the book, was sent in to the author sometime around 1882, eleven years before the Malay kite was mentioned in the newspaper.


== Design ==
The Malay is similar in design to the standard Eddy design. The precise design of the kite consists of two flexible cross sticks, diverging at right angles, to form a lozenge-like shape. The horizontal stick is preferably slightly longer than the vertical one. Once they have been bound together, a string or cord is tightened around the resulting lozenge. The design is then enveloped in the kite material, such as paper. This particular design, when correctly executed, allows the wind to carry the kite to great heights, despite its lack of any kind of tail.
This diamond-bowed design gave inspiration to other designs, such as the aforementioned and now popular ""Eddy"" kite, designed by William Abner Eddy of Bayonne, New Jersey. The ""Eddy"" model, created four years after the Western appearance of the Malay in 1894, and patented approximately twenty months after that — application for ""Kite"" filed on 1 August 1898, by ""William A. Eddy of Bayonne, New Jersey"", U.S. patent number 646375 (issued on 27 March 1900) — has grown to become one of the most common and popular designs of kite in the 21st century.

Pigloo,Start,1,"Pigloo is a baby penguin and the main character of a musical dance project. The project's first and most successful single came in 2006: ""Papa Pingouin,"" a cover of a song performed in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1980. Pigloo is most popular in France.


== Biography ==
An animated music video for ""Papa Pingouin"" was produced, featuring a penguin dad and his son. This song was very successful in France, where it topped the singles chart for three weeks and eventually remained on the chart for 27 weeks. In February 2007, the German version of ""Papa Pinguoin"" climbed to 6th place in the German hit parade, partly due to the huge success of the video clip broadcast on RTL. The French version was sung by Heidi, while the German version was sung by Sara and Kerstin.
In June 2006, Pigloo released a second single, ""Le ragga des pingouins"", then ""Ça plane pour moi (Le twist)"" in September 2006, ""Moi, j'aime skier!"" (based on the melody of ""Y.M.C.A."") in December 2006, and ""Bizoo d'eskimo"" in July 2007. All these singles were top 20 hits in France. His first album, La Banquise, was released in July 2006.

Conditional_factor_demands,Start,1,"In economics, a conditional factor demand is the cost-minimizing level of an input (factor of production) such as  labor or capital, required to produce a given level of output, for given unit input costs (wage rate and cost of capital) of the input factors. A conditional factor demand function expresses the conditional factor demand as a function of the output level and the input costs. The conditional portion of this phrase refers to the fact that this function is conditional on a given level of output, so output is one argument of the function. Typically this concept arises in a long run context in which both labor and capital usage are choosable by the firm, so a single optimization gives rise to conditional factor demands for each of labor and capital.
Since the optimal mix of input levels depends on the wage and rental rates, these rates are also arguments of the conditional demand functions for the inputs. This concept is similar to but distinct from the factor demand functions, which give the optimal demands for the inputs when the level of output is free to be chosen; since output is not fixed in that case, output is not an argument of those demand functions.


== Optimization problem ==

In the simplest mathematical formulation of this problem, two inputs are used (often labor and capital), and the optimization problem seeks to minimize the total cost (amount spent on factors of production, say labor and physical  capital) subject to achieving a given level of output, as illustrated in the graph. Each of the convex isoquants shows various combinations of labor and capital usage all of which would allow a given amount of output to be produced. Each straight line segment is an isocost curve showing various amounts of labor and capital whose combined usage would cost a given amount unique to that isocost curve. Conditional on producing the amount of output consistent with, say, the middle isoquant, the lowest cost can be obtained by using amounts of labor and capital such that the point on the given isoquant is on the lowest possible isocost curve—that is, at the point of tangency between the given isoquant and one of the cost curves. At the tangency the marginal rate of technical substitution between the factors (the absolute value of the slope of the isoquant at the optimal point) equals the relative factor costs (the absolute value of the slope of the isocost curve).
This optimization can be formalized as follows:

  
    
      
        
          Minimize
        
        
        w

          and
        
        
        
        K
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\text{Minimize}}\,wL+rK\,\,{\text{with respect to}}\,\,L\,\,{\text{and}}\,\,K,}
  

subject to

  
    
      
        f
        (
        L
        ,
        K
        )
        =
        q
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(L,K)=q,}
  

where L and K are the chosen quantities of labor and capital, w and r are the fixed unit costs of labor (wage rate) and capital (rental rate) respectively, f is the production function specifying how much output can be produced with any combination of inputs, and q is the fixed level of output required.
The resulting factor demand functions are of the general form

  
    
      
        L
        (
        w
        ,
        r
        
        ;
        q
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle L(w,r\,;q)}
  

for labor demand, and

  
    
      
        K
        (
        w
        ,
        r
        
        ;
        q
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle K(w,r\,;q).}
  

for demand for physical capital. That the wage rate and capital rental rates affect the optimal input quantities can also be seen graphically because they both affect the slope of the isocost curves in the above graph, while the required quantity q of output affects them because it determines the relevant isoquant in the graph.


== Expansion path ==

As the target level of output is increased, the relevant isoquant becomes farther and farther out from the origin, and still it is optimal in a cost-minimization sense to operate at the tangency point of the relevant isoquant with an isocost curve. The set of all such tangency points is called the firm's expansion path.

National_Fitness_Council,Start,1,"The National Fitness Council in the UK (1937 - 1939) was a government organisation to promote fitness set up according to the Physical Training and Recreation Act, 1937.
The Secretary was Lionel Ellis.
The National Fitness Council consisted of an Advisory Committee for England and Wales and a Grant Committee. There were 22 Area Committees to review existing facilities, to encourage local schemes, to consider applications for grant and to forward these applications with their recommendations to the Grants Committee.
It provided grants towards the provision of playing fields, boys' clubs, youth hostels, gymnasia, swimming baths and expert leadership. Over 865 schemes were funded fully, or in part during the Council's existence although there was debate over its effectiveness. The grants were intended to improve facilities in poorer regions of the country.
The Council was suspended at the start of the Second World War and was not continued post-war, transferring its activities to the Ministry of Education.

WWE_Speed,Start,1,"WWE Speed is an American professional wrestling streaming television program produced by WWE. It airs on the social media platform X and premiered with two episodes on April 3, 2024. Speed features wrestlers from WWE's Raw, SmackDown, and NXT brands. Regular episodes have one match each with a time limit of three minutes, while special episodes for the WWE Speed Championship have a longer duration of five minutes. Matches for Speed are taped in conjunction with WWE's main weekly television programs, Monday Night Raw and Friday Night SmackDown.


== History ==
On February 7, 2024, the American professional wrestling promotion WWE filed to trademark the name ""WWE Speed"" for an in-ring program in which the concept would be that the professional wrestling matches would have a five-minute time limit. The concept was first tested as dark matches before the December 15, 2023, taping of SmackDown. On February 8 during the WrestleMania XL Kickoff press conference, WWE announced a partnership with X to introduce WWE Speed, which would stream weekly on the social media platform. The deal between WWE and X was confirmed for two years. It was also revealed that the matches for each episode would be exclusive to the platform and would not be repurposed from WWE's other programs, and it would feature wrestlers from all three of WWE's brands: Raw, SmackDown, and NXT.
On March 27, WWE commentator Corey Graves announced that Speed would premiere on Wednesday, April 3, but matches would instead be three minutes in length. Also announced was a tournament to crown the inaugural WWE Speed Champion for men. The debut episode, which was uploaded at 12 p.m. Eastern Time (ET), saw Ricochet defeat Dragon Lee. Roughly 30 minutes later, WWE uploaded a second episode in which Bronson Reed defeated Cedric Alexander. Graves served as the sole commentator for the episodes. While the first few episodes only featured matches with male wrestlers, during a conversation on X Spaces on May 1, 2024, WWE Chief Content Officer Paul ""Triple H"" Levesque confirmed that the program would also feature women's matches.
While the program typically airs on Wednesdays, a special Friday airing occurred on May 3, 2024. This episode, which was the seventh episode overall, saw the crowning of the inaugural Speed Champion. This episode also confirmed that championship matches would air on Fridays and would have a five-minute time limit instead of the regular three. During the special airing, Ricochet defeated Johnny Gargano to become the show's inaugural champion.

Saab_Aero-X,Start,1,"The Saab Aero-X is a concept car built by Saab, which was unveiled at the 2006 Salon International de l'Auto.
It is powered by a 2.8 L twin turbocharged V6 running on pure ethanol that produces 298 kW (400 hp). The 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) time was predicted to be 4.9 seconds and the top speed is 255 km/h (158 mph). It has a seven speed manual transmission controlled by paddles on the steering wheel.
Like the later Saab Turbo X, the Aero-X has four wheel drive. The doors and windscreen are connected, so instead of using conventional doors or even gullwing doors, it uses a cockpit canopy where the entire top section of the car is opened. This offers the Aero X's driver full 180 degree vision, and also facilitates entry and exit from its low slung cabin. The body is made of carbon fiber. 
The suspension is electronically controlled. Even though it is a two seat sports car, it has reasonable storage, as the rear features two storage facilities, with a conventional hatchback and sliding drawer underneath. The interior offers ""clean Scandinavian interior design"". The car has no ordinary dials and buttons; instead, data is displayed on acrylic 'clear zones' in graphic 3D images. All interior and exterior lights utilize LEDs.
Although only a concept car, it has been well received, with many fans calling for its production. Victor Muller responded on the SaabsUnited.com website, saying that it is not a priority for the company right now. 
""This study shows how the strength of the Saab brand heritage can inspire bold, innovative design"", said Bryan Nesbitt, the Executive Director of GM Design Europe: ""As we move forward with new Saab product, we will remain focused on carefully cultivating this brand equity in the context of Scandinavian design values"".
""This concept shows the exciting possibilities that are open to us as we evolve a more progressive design language for the Saab brand"", said Jan Åke Jonsson, Saab's Managing Director. ""Our designers, engineers and marketers in Sweden are ideally placed to nurture and communicate the unique DNA of the Saab brand. Their work will ensure that future product proposals express core qualities, such as progressive design, sporty performance and emotional functionality, in a way that is specific to Saab."" Elements of the cars frontal design have emerged in later Saab models, notably the design refresh of the Saab 9-3 Sports Sedan, the second generation Saab 9-5 and the Saab 9-4X.
The Aero-X was rumored to make its cinematic début in Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, with fans speculating that it may be used for the Autobot Wheeljack. However, it was not used.

Time_slicing_(digital_broadcasting),Start,1,"Time slicing is a technique used by the DVB-H and ATSC-M/H technologies for achieving power-savings on mobile terminal devices. It is based on the time-multiplexed transmission of different services.
DVB-H and ATSC-M/H transmit large pieces of data in bursts, allowing the receiver to be switched off in inactive periods. The result is power savings of up to 90% - and the same inactive receiver could be used to monitor neighboring cells for seamless handovers.


== Detailed description ==


=== Motivation ===
A special problem for mobile terminals is the limited battery capacity. In a way, being compatible with a broadband terrestrial service would place a burden on the mobile terminal, because demodulating and decoding a high data-rate stream involves certain power dissipation in the tuner and the demodulator. An investigation at the beginning of the development of DVB-H showed that the total power consumption of a DVB-T front end was more than 1 Watt at the time of the examination and was expected not to decrease below 600 mW until 2006; meanwhile a somewhat lower value seems possible but the envisaged target of 100 mW as a maximum threshold for the entire front end incorporated in a DVB-H terminal is still unobtainable for a DVB-T receiver.
A considerable drawback for battery-operated terminals is the fact that with DVB-T or ATSC, the whole data stream has to be decoded before any one of the services (TV programmes) of the multiplex can be accessed. The power saving made possible by time slicing is derived from the fact that essentially only those parts of the stream which carry the data of the service currently selected have to be processed. However, the data stream needs to be reorganized in a suitable way for that purpose. In DVB-H and ATSC-M/H, service multiplexing is performed in a pure time-division multiplex. The data of one particular service are therefore not transmitted continuously but in compact periodical bursts with interruptions in between. Multiplexing of several services leads again to a continuous, uninterrupted transmitted stream of constant data-rate.


=== Burst transmission ===
This kind of signal can be received time-selectively: the terminal synchronizes to the bursts of the wanted service but switches to a power-save mode during the intermediate time when other services are being transmitted. The power-save time between bursts, relative to the on-time required for the reception of an individual service, is a direct measure of the power saving provided by time slicing. Bursts entering the receiver have to be buffered and read out of the buffer at the service data-rate. The amount of data contained in one burst needs to be sufficient for bridging the power-save period of the front end. For tuning into a stream, a burst needs to carry a video frame that allows the decoder to display the video instantaneously, otherwise, the next burst has to be awaited.
The position of the bursts is signaled in terms of the relative time difference between two consecutive bursts of the same service. This information is called ""delta t"". It is transmitted multiple times within a single burst as to provide error redundancy.
Practically, the duration of one burst is in the range of several hundred milliseconds whereas the power-save time may amount to several seconds. A lead time for powering up the front end, for resynchronization, etc. has to be taken into account; this time period is assumed to be less than 250 ms according to the DVB-H technical standard. Depending on the ratio of on-time / power-save time, the resulting power saving may be more than 90%.
As an example, the figure on the right shows a portion of a data stream containing time-sliced services. One quarter of the assumed total capacity of a DVB-T channel of 13.27 Mbit/s is assigned to DVB-H services whereas the remaining capacity is shared between ordinary DVB-T services. This example shows that it is feasible to transmit both DVB-T and DVB-H within the same network.

Vice versa, the OFF time that is to be used can be calculated from the actual constant bitrate of the video stream. This is more intuitive, since the constant (or average) video bitrate is known before applying time slicing.

=== Benefits and Disadvantages ===
Time slicing requires a sufficiently high number of multiplexed services and a certain minimum burst data-rate to guarantee effective power saving. Basically, the power consumption of the front end correlates with the service data-rate of the service currently selected.
Time slicing offers another benefit for the terminal architecture. The rather long power-save periods may be used to search for channels in neighboring radio cells offering the selected service. This way a channel handover can be performed at the border between two cells which remains imperceptible for the user. Both the monitoring of the services in adjacent cells and the reception of the selected service data can be done with the same front end.

Standard_for_Exchange_of_Non-clinical_Data,Start,1,"The Standard for Exchange of Nonclinical Data (SEND) is an implementation of the CDISC Standard Data Tabulation Model (SDTM) for nonclinical studies, which specifies a way to present nonclinical data in a consistent format. These types of studies are related to animal testing conducted during drug development. Raw data of toxicology animal studies started after December 18, 2016 to support submission of new drugs to the US Food and Drug Administration will be submitted to the agency using SEND.
Having a common model to which the industry can conform enables benefits such as the ability for vendors to develop tools, for inter-organizational data exchange that is consistent in format regardless of the parties involved, and so on.
A SEND package consists of a few parts, but the main focus is on individual endpoint data.  Endpoints typically map to domains (essentially, datasets), with a number of variables (a.k.a., columns or fields).


== Implementation ==
The SEND Implementation Guide (SENDIG) is a document that provides implementers with specifications for implementing SEND, including how to model various nonclinical endpoints, rules to doing so, and examples with sample data.  This document is available on the CDISC SEND website.
Supplementing the guide is the SEND Implementation Wiki hosted by PhUSE designed to assist with the implementation process and filling in some of the gaps, most notably containing:

SEND, CT, and Define.xml Fundamentals pages – providing more approachable descriptions of fundamental concepts in SEND
Getting SEND-ready – to help new implementers get started
FAQ – providing a large, evolving list of commonly asked questions
Companion to the wiki is the SEND Implementation Forum, which allows implementers to ask questions and get responses from SEND experts.  New implementers are encouraged to ask questions here.


== History ==
The work on this standard began in July 2002—subsequently, a U.S. Food and Drug Administration pilot project was initiated in July 2003 through a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA). Feedback from this pilot and continuous efforts to more closely align this implementation with the SDTM for human clinical trials led to development of SEND 2.3, but without widespread adoption.
In 2006, with renewed FDA interest, the industry met to revive SEND and work on a version that, with FDA backing, would cover regulatory submission as well as operational data transfer needs.  By 2007, an FDA pilot was announced, during which time the SEND team worked on the SENDIG (implementation guide).
SENDIG 3.0 was released to production in July 2011. This was soon followed by the FDA's statement of preference for SEND datasets.
In December 2014, the FDA CDER and CBER divisions released guidance for industry enforcing the usage of SEND as part of Investigational New Drug (IND) and Biologic License Application (BLA) submission to the US Food and Drug Administration. All studies started after December 15, 2016 supporting IND and BLA submissions will need to be compliant with SEND. The Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency in Japan will enforce its use in the future, most probably in 2020. The European Medicines Agency also expressed interest and is recommending the use of SEND.
SENDIG 3.1 was released in June 2016, extending the format with new data domains. 
SENDIG-DART 1.1 was released in December 2017. SENDIG-DART is a standard which extends the SENDIG 3.1 standard for use with Segment II Development and Reproductive Toxicology Studies.
Consider the SENDIG and the PhUSE SEND Implementation Wiki pages for additional related information.

Stolen_Ogre,Start,1,"Stolen Ogre is an American rock band based in Seattle, Washington. Michael McMorrow and Blues Traveler drummer Brendan Hill formed the group after they met on the H.O.R.D.E. tour in the mid-1990s.
The band's current members are lead singer-songwriter Pamela Tobiason, keyboardist/songwriter Michael McMorrow, guitarist David Simpson, saxophonist/singer the Reverend Scott ""Junior"" Adams, bassist Marc Willett and drummer Rick Boice. Brendan Hill's Traveler duties eventually led him to stop his regular appearances with the group, although he went on to record with the band on Road To Jericho and still remains a creative collaborator.
The band takes its name from a child's doll that Hill spotted on the roadside of the German Autobahn. Christened 'Ogre', and enthroned on Hill's drum kit, it became his good luck mascot through Blues Traveler's early years. After Ogre vanished on tour, McMorrow, Hill and company adopted the name in playful tribute to the circumstances.


== Road To Jericho ==
In the spring of 2004, Stolen Ogre released their first full-length album Road to Jericho on the Seattle-based Shadowhawk Records. Two songs, ""Jericho"" and ""Love Me Alone"" went on to receive airplay nationwide.


=== Critical reception ===
Pennsylvania's WVIA-FM had the album on the charts for eight weeks with it peaking at No. 2 for two weeks. Enigma Magazine noted of the CD, ""Bottom line it's rock, folk, jam and pop all mixed together into one big happy concoction."" 
Stolen Ogre played its debut New York City show at the famed Lion's Den with The Village Voice giving the show a ""Recommended"" note by writer Richard Gehr. The band continued on with shows at the legendary Asbury Park club The Saint and NYC's Acme Underground. The Northeast swing and Road to Jericho were highlighted in both www.Jambands.com and www.Jambase.com.
After Relix Magazine President and Publisher Steve Bernstein and other Relix staffers saw the Stolen Ogre set at Lion's Den, the band was invited to play a private mid-day concert the magazine's home office in Manhattan. A live recording of that show hit www.archive.org; Stolen Ogre remained in the Top 5 downloaded shows for over a month with nearly 4000 downloads.


== Other releases ==
The band released its first Christmas single ""Little Drummer Boy"" to AAA & NPR radio.
Stolen Ogre is currently writing songs for the follow-up to Road to Jericho and are in planning for the next tour and festival dates.
In 2007 new material from Stolen Ogre is being recorded at Robert Lang Studios in Seattle, including a brand new McMorrow composition ""Tequila Mockingbird"" that features John Popper.

Art_cluster,Start,1,"Art Cluster, in global contemporary art scene, refers a group of artists that work through Internet to promote the free culture and many artistic values.
The emerging telecommunications have developed a new form of communication, much faster and more direct. This allows people to work from anywhere in the world. People can easily group or perform any type of organization.
Art Cluster also refers artistic production of collective intelligence. The integration of social movement in the cyberspace is one of the potential strategies of this social movement.


== Precedents and precursors ==
In Manhattan in 2003 Bill Wasik, senior editor of Harper's Magazine, creates the first Flash mob. A flash mob is a group of people who assemble suddenly in a public place, perform an unusual and seemingly pointless act for a brief time, then quickly disperse, often for the purposes of entertainment, satire, and artistic expression. Flash mobs began as a form of performance art. While they started as an apolitical act, flash mobs may share superficial similarities to political demonstrations. Flash mobs can be seen as a specialized form of smart mob, a term and concept proposed by author Howard Rheingold in his 2002 book Smart Mobs: The Next Social Revolution.
The convergence culture is an important factor in Art Cluster. Henry Jenkins determines convergence culture to be the flow of content across multiple media platforms, the cooperation between multiple media industries, and the migratory behavior of media audiences who will go almost anywhere in search of the kinds of entertainment experiences they want.
Art Cluster actions were captured in the form of itinerant exhibitions and printed editions of fanzines in 2005.This collective actions was promoted by Jofre Oliveras, artist and cultural manager who created the movement in Spain.


== Use of the term ==
The first documented use of the term Art Cluster as it is understood today was in 2011 in a blog entry posted in the aftermath of cultural platform event from Girona.
The term was inspired by the computing cluster that consists of a set of loosely connected computers that work together so that in many respects they can be viewed as a single system.

Provveditori_all'Armar,Start,1,"The Provveditori all'Armar (lit. 'superintendents on armament') were officials of the Republic of Venice responsible for the provisioning and equipment of the ships and crews of the Venetian navy.


== History ==
Up to the mid-16th century, naval matters were supervised by the five-member board of the Savi agli Ordini, but gradually a more complex and professional administration was built up. 
As part of this process, already in 1497, two patricians were entrusted with supervising naval affairs, as the Provveditori ed esecutori alle cose marittime, whose number was raised to three in 1499. In 1545, two Provveditori all'Armar were established, raised in 1644 to three, to supervise the provisioning, equipment and clothing of the fleet and its crews. They had the right to appoint any officer other than patricians, and to try disputes between officers, sailors, and convict crewmen. As such, they formed part of the Venetian admiralty, the Collegio della Milizia da Mar, along with the Provveditori of the Venetian Arsenal and other officials.
The Provveditori all'Armar had to be kept abreast of the location and role of all naval personnel at all times, so that anyone required for a particular task might be mobilized at once. This lasted until the end of the 16th century. With the onset of a longer period of peace after that, the rolls of eligible personnel, supposed to be renewed every ten years, were neglected.
The Provveditori all'Armar were also responsible for supervising the outfitting and decommissioning of every warship in person, checking the presence of the assigned crews and material and the accounting books, and of handing over to the captains their written instructions. All senior naval commanders (Capi da Mare) had to file reports every two months to the Provveditori all'Armar on wages and other expenses, while the Provveditori themselves were obliged to perform monthly inspections. Galley captains (Sopracomiti) were obliged to report the number of their hired crewmen and the money owed to the Provveditori upon the decommissioning of their ship within 15 days.

Fillomino,Start,1,"Fillomino (フィルオミノ) is a type of logic puzzle published by many publishers.  Other published titles for the puzzle include Allied Occupation.


== Rules ==
Fillomino is played on a rectangular grid with no standard size; the internal grid lines are often dotted.  (When published as Allied Occupation in the World Puzzle Championship, the cells of the grid are circular, but this is purely an aesthetic concern.)  Some cells of the grid start containing numbers, referred to as ""givens"".  The goal is to divide the grid into regions called polyominoes (by filling in their boundaries) such that each given number n in the grid satisfies the following constraints:

Each clue n is part of a polyomino of size n;
no two polyominoes of matching size (number of cells) are orthogonally adjacent (share a side).
It is possible for two givens with matching number to belong to the same polyomino in the solution, and for a polyomino to have no given at all.


== Solution methods ==
It is common practice in solving a Fillomino puzzle to add numbers to the empty cells when it is determined what size polyomino each must belong to; these numbers are effectively treated identically to the givens.  As well as making it clear where many border segments must be drawn—such as between any two differing numbers, or surrounding a region of matching numbers whose quantity is that number—it also permits the second part of the puzzle's rule to be visualized as simply ""the same number cannot appear on both sides of a border"", which greatly accelerates solving.  A curious side effect of numbering every cell is that when the puzzle is completed, the numbers alone unambiguously define the solution, the actual borders being trivially deducible.  This makes communication of a solution without a grid quite feasible; indeed, solutions for Allied Occupation give only the numbers.  (Nikoli always publishes solutions to their Fillomino puzzles with both the polyomino borders drawn in and numbers given in every cell.)
The typical means of starting a Fillomino puzzle is to draw in the obvious borders between non-matching givens and surrounding all polyominoes completed by the givens alone ('1's, pairs of orthogonally adjacent '2's, and so on).  From there, the solver searches for three things, possibly in combination:

Potential overloads.  Each polyomino in the solution, if it were completely numbered, would contain matching numbers whose quantity is that number.  If there is a place in the grid where adding a particular number would result in an orthogonally-contiguous region of too many copies of that number, then borders to that cell from those numbers may be drawn in.  Often the givens alone provide these, most commonly a pair of diagonally adjacent '2's: placing a '2' in either of the cells that share a side with both givens would result in an overload, so four cell borders may be drawn in (in the shape of a plus sign) separating the '2's.
Limited domains.  Every number in the grid - whether given or deduced - must ultimately be bordered into a region with that number of cells in it.  Often, a number will require other cells to be in its region due to not having any alternative location to expand into.  The most obvious case is a number (other than 1) bordered on three sides; the cell sharing the fourth side must belong to the same region, and consequently can bear the same number.  The same principle applies to numbers bordered on only two sides but cannot possibly expand into enough cells in only one direction, and so on.
Defined cells.  In more challenging circumstances, sometimes working with the empty cells is easier than working with numbers.  The most obvious case is when a single cell without a number becomes completely surrounded; without any help from other numbers, that cell must be a monomino, and can be marked with 1.  Similarly, two orthogonally adjacent empty cells surrounded together must be a domino, as two monominos cannot share a side.  Even cells in regions not completely surrounded may be defined; a common occurrence is for an empty cell as part of a small region mostly bordered by solved polyominoes to have only one legal size of polyomino available to it, with other sizes being too large or would result in matching-size polyominoes sharing a side.  This is perhaps best recognized by considering what number can legally be placed in such a cell and determining that only one exists.


== Variants ==
Fillomino adapts to different geometries; hexagonal grids can be used, with the only change in the rules being replacing all instances of polyomino with polyhex.  Another variant was published by Nikoli under the name NIKOJI; letters are used as givens instead of numbers, where the letters and polyominoes have a one-to-one correspondence and only matching letters have matching polyominoes (in size, shape, orientation, and letter position).
A computer-based variant of the game in which the player enters numbers (the computer draws the boundaries for the player) is known ""Filling"" and is part of the ""SGT-Puzzles"" package.
An iOS mobile variant of Fillomino, named Fields, was launched in 2013.

Waldstock_Festival_UK,Start,1,"Waldstock is an annual charity music festival held in the grounds of the Fighting Cocks Public House, Wendens Ambo, Essex. Waldstock is organised entirely by volunteers, many of them musicians themselves, and the bands who appear give their time totally free of charge.


== Founding ==
The idea for Waldstock began after a previous event at the venue, organised by an independent third-party, was not given license to go ahead by the council in May 2010. A small committee of local musicians and music fans put the event together in just five weeks, and it was held on 19 and 20 June 2010.
The first festival received an excellent response from local people, as the local press reported; ""Hundreds of music lovers attended the two day Waldstock charity music festival...they were treated to some of the finest bands in the area, including Dennis Stratton & Tommy Dunn, Supercasino, Another Storm, Aliceband, This Way Up, and The Wrinklies."" 


== Fundraising ==

Waldstock's primary aim apart from promoting local music and arts, is to raise money for local charitable causes.
In 2011 the principle charitable beneficiary was the emergency first response team, ""MEDICS"".
Waldstock also supported two other local, smaller, charitable causes in 2011.
In 2010, the event raised £2,500, donating £2,000 to Carver Barracks’ Injured Soldiers’ Fund, and guitars (worth £500) to Uttlesford Youth Music Project, based at Fairycroft centre, Saffron Walden.


== Bands ==

Waldstock relies on the input and performances of local and regional bands who give their time and music freely. In 2011 the festival had a lineup of over 25 bands, including: Zocalo, Guardians of Andromeda, Ivan & The Wolves, She Makes War, The Pins, The Strangerhood, AlicebanD, and Gema Hadridge.

William_of_Lindholme,Start,1,"William of Lindholme (A.K.A. William de Lindholme) is a legendary figure in English folklore, who lived in a hermitage on an island (an area now called Lindholme) in the middle of the Hatfield Chase, today located in the Metropolitan Borough of Doncaster. Many differing tales were told about William, from him being born a Giant, to him being either a Satanic Magician or a Righteous Monk. What can be extracted is that William was a real hermit, living in the Lindholme waste, likely where Rangjung Yeshe Gomde Tibetan Buddhist Centre now stands.


== Earliest Reports ==
The earliest report of William comes from the will of John Symson of Fish Lake, dated to March 23, 1407, in which he bequeaths 7 pence to the hermit of Lindholme.
According to the Yorkshire Archaeological Journal, the MSS of Dr. Nathaniel Johnston, which number over 100 volumes, contain information and references to the occupant of the hermitage at Lindholme.
The diary of Rev. Abraham De La Pryme contains the following section about William:
July 28, 1697
“Having been in Yorkshire this last week, I met with diverse learned and ingenious gentlemen, who told me a great many observable things.
It was upon Hanson’s house at Hale’s Hill, Woodhouse, that St. William a’ Lindholme set his wagon. One Hanson lived there then. Look and see when the Hansons lived, and you may find perhaps when William a’ Lindholme lived.”
Investigative research done by William Brockhurst Stonehouse, published in his 1839 book ""The History and Topography of the Isle of Axholme"", uncovered that the burial stone of William of Lindholme was no longer there, however his burial place was still at that time visible. The stone having been broken down and used as cobblestone by a previous owner of the land. The burial stone was described by Antiquarian George Stovin, whom, according to an August 31, 1727 letter printed in the Gentleman's Magazine, exhumed William's body, he stated that the stone was 8½ feet in length, 3 feet in breadth and 8 feet in thickness. He also described an altar on the opposite side of the island made of hewn stone.
He also stated that upon exhuming his body they uncovered a skull, tooth and hip bone from a very large human, as well as the remains of a bag of hemp seed and a large beaten copper plate with two chevrons on it.
He is held to have thrown the ""thumb stone"" and ""little-finger stone"" from Lindholme to Wroot, some three miles distant.

Calty_Design_Research,Start,1,"Calty Design Research Incorporated (also simply known as Calty) is a Toyota design studio established in 1973.  They have two facilities: one in Newport Beach, California for concept designs, and another in Ann Arbor, Michigan for production designs.  Calty provides both interior and exterior styling proposals for future Toyota vehicles and advanced design, production color and wheel design concepts for Toyota's product development operations.
Calty was initially created by Noritsuna Watanabe and David J. Stollery in 1973 at El Segundo, California. In 1976, Toyota sent Kazuo Morohoshi to rebuild the design center into a much stronger entity. Morohoshi was an assistant manager in Toyota who had recent completed work on the third generation Corolla and the Tercel and Corsa. His task was to build a long term design center in America to cater for American tastes and styles rather than catering to Japanese tastes and styles. Morohoshi had to develop both the direction for the new center and physical realities such as selecting the building, fitting it out and hiring staff. He choose to staff it with Americans, even though there were often cultural misunderstandings between himself and the American staff for a while. After one year under Morohoshi's management, Calty started working on the second generation Celica, aimed at the American market. American sales soon picked up as a result of the styling being aim at American tastes.

With the aid of design consultant and longtime Art Center faculty member Strother MacMinn, pure research was also undertaken in the form of concept cars. These paved the way for features incorporated into future Toyota cars. Feedback about the concept cars also allowed Toyota to gauge how American audiences perceived styling issues, which were often different from how the Japanese perceived them.
Morohoshi was called back to Japan in 1983 to head up Advanced Design at the Nagoya Design Division in Japan. The building he choose for Calty in Newport Beach is still being used by Calty.
When Toyota decided to build a luxury car (the Lexus LS400), it was aimed at the 43 year old white American male earning $100,000 per year (in 1987 dollars). A team of Japanese designers was sent to California to discover what this demographic looked for in a car and how it reflected their lifestyle. This team worked closely with Calty. As representatives of the target market, Calty was also involved in the exterior and interior design. However, Calty's sporty designs came into conflict with executives in Japan, who favored a more conservative car that appealed to middle-aged Japanese executives. Calty was also involved with the design of the new Lexus dealerships and the early training of these new dealers.
Toyota's design centers around the world often participated together to design new cars. For example, in February 1996 there was a competition among the design centers for the design of the first generation Prius. The Calty design was chosen, although the detailed work to turn it into a production car was done by Development Center 2 in Japan.

Natraj_Temple,Start,1,"Natraj Temple [natˈrɑːʒ ˈtem.pəl] was a nightclub in Munich, Germany from 1996 to 2008. Germany's first steady psytrance  nightclub belonged, besides the Tresor and E-Werk in Berlin, the Dorian Gray and Omen in Frankfurt, and the Munich-based clubs Ultraschall, KW – Das Heizkraftwerk and Millennium, to the most renowned clubs of Germany's 1990s techno culture, and was considered an international centre of the Goa trance movement.


== History and description ==


=== Significance ===
The significance of the Natraj Temple for the rave culture is due to the fact that it was one of only a few clubs that specialized completely in a single subgenre, in this case psytrance. In the Goa and psytrance scene, decorations based on Hindu, Buddhist or shamanic motifs and symbols as well as spirituality and often excessive intoxication play an important role. Accordingly, the media coverage about the nightclub mostly focused on the psychedelic design of the venue, the elaborate art installations and the alternative scene clientele. Thus Der Spiegel described the Natraj Temple as a place ""where many colourful cloths decorate the high walls and long-haired people can smoke their joint under purple light and listening to Indian music"".  The Süddeutsche Zeitung described the interior of the club as ""ghost train ambience, fluorescent cobwebs, an Indian, four-armed goddess is rotating in the semi-darkness"", and reported about women sitting cross-legged, visitors who talked for hours with the decoration of the club, and about ""Goa freaks who left the Natraj Temple half-naked and barefoot in the deepest winter, wallowing in the snow and then calling for an ambulance"". Also travel guides and cultural guidebooks reported, besides the musical specialization on psytrance, mostly about the artistic design of the nightclub. The Kulturverführer München reported about a dragon above the dance floor, ""cuddly cushions in mysterious niches"" and an intense palette of colours in the decoration. Due to these special features the psytrance club made a name for itself also outside the scene throughout Europe.


=== Program and festivals ===
The musical program of the club concentrated on electronic music of the styles psychedelic trance and Goa trance. Often international DJ's and live acts of the psytrance scene played at the Natraj Temple. Regular events at the club carried names like Psychedelic Trance and Special Experience. The Natraj Temple regularly presented his own lovemobiles at Munich's technoparade Union Move and was known for the elaborate and psychedelic design of the floats. The club also organized open air festivals under the name Natraj Summer Dance.


== Location ==
The club was located on the grounds of the Kunstpark Ost factory site in Munich's Berg am Laim district in a disused former power plant. It consisted of a main area with a wooden dance floor, which was surrounded one floor above by a large gallery with the so-called chill-out area, and an adjoining bar room with a kiosk where exotic spices were sold in addition to drinks. In 2003 the Natraj Temple moved into the rooms of the former club K41, and in 2007 once again into the rooms of the former Octagon club.


== Compilation albums ==
The club regularly released compilation albums with names like Natraj Summer Dance or Winterdance.

Osnabrück_Town_Hall,Start,1,"The Town Hall (German: Rathaus) of Osnabrück, Germany, was built in the late Gothic style from 1487 to 1512. It is one of Osnabrück's most important buildings and emblems and continues to be used as the city's town hall today. The Treaty of Westphalia was negotiated and signed by the combatants of the Thirty Years' War at the town halls of Osnabrück and Münster in 1648.


== History ==
Osnabrück's old town hall at the Markt (market place) continued to be used into the 16th century. However, during the previous century, the council of the Hansestadt (Hanseatic city) of Osnabrück had ordered the construction of a new town hall. Construction started in 1487; in 1505 the building was topped out. In 1512 the construction of Osnabrück's new town hall was completed. However, it was not until 1575 when the interior decoration was finally finished.
The final years of the Thirty Years' War were the most significant in the building's history. From 1643 to 1648 part of the delegations sent by the combatants in the Thirty Years' War sat in Osnabrück's town hall to negotiate a peace settlement. The eventual outcome was the ""Westfälischer Frieden von Osnabrück und Münster"" (Westphalian Peace Treaty of Osnabrück and Münster), signed in 1648. Among those who sat in the town hall of Osnabrück were the envoys representing the Kingdom of Sweden along with those representing the emperor and also the imperial estates; in contrast those representing the emperor and France negotiated simultaneously at the town hall in Münster. Today the negotiations are commemorated by portraits of the 42 European envoys at the Friedenskongress (peace congress), positioned around the walls of the Friedenssaal (Hall of Peace) in the town hall. In addition there are three portraits of the rulers of the main combatant nations: Christina, Queen of Sweden, Louis XIV of France, and German Emperor Ferdinand III.
From 1846 to 1880 the town hall's original Friedenssaal was converted into a so-called ""Prunkhalle"" (luxury hall). This modification was undone at the start of the 20th century, restoring the Friedenssaal to its original state.
On 13 September 1944 the town hall of Osnabrück was struck numerous times by Allied (especially British) bombs during air raids and severely damaged. The town hall was burned down to its foundation walls. As almost all of the historic furnishings of the town hall had been placed in storage some time earlier on account of the local population's expectation of eventual destruction, the majority of the interior decorations were saved. On 24 October 1948 – just in time for the 300th anniversary celebrations of the Peace of Westphalia – the restored town hall, along with its historic furnishings, was officially reopened for business.


== Structural information ==
The town hall of Osnabrück is built in the late Gothic style. The exterior design of the building makes a considerable impact on the observer. The frontal view is characterised by an 18-metre-high hipped roof, whose height is almost equal to that of the rest of the building from the foundation slab to the eaves. A total of six towers are positioned at the lower end of the roof, reminiscent of watchtowers and corner towers of a fortress. In addition there has been a large flight of steps in front of the town hall since 1846, leading to the roughly 500-year-old entrance door from two sides (previously accessed via a retractable set of wooden steps). The handle of this door is made of heavy bronze and displays the year ""1648”; it also features a dove.
A statue of Charlemagne – founder of the city and the Roman Catholic Diocese of Osnabrück – stands above the entrance. Featured alongside him on both sides are the so-called ""Kaiser-Plastiken""  (emperor sculptures): depicting the German emperors Sigismund, Frederick II (House of Hohenstaufen), Rudolf of Habsburg, Wilhelm I (also King of Prussia), Frederick Barbarossa, Arnulf of Carinthia, Maximilian I and Ludwig the Bavarian. The statues were gifted to the town hall by the Prussian royal family in the 19th century, which explains the presence of the Prussian king and, later, German Emperor Wilhelm I in the row of emperors.
The Friedensaal is located a few metres behind the entrance door to the left; directly opposite is the town hall treasury. A variety of precious items is stored and displayed here, among them the civic silver, coins, embossing stamps and various documents. Particularly noteworthy items are the valuable imperial goblet from the 13th/14th century and Osnabrück's oldest skirmish line. In addition there are documents of historical significance on display, including a replica of the Peace of Westphalia – the ""Osnabrücker Friedensinstrument"" (Osnabrück Instrument of Peace) – along with a copy of the document with which Emperor Frederick Barbarossa granted the people of Osnabrück the right to exercise their own jurisdiction in 1171.
On the upper floor there is a model of the city of Osnabrück depicting it as it would have looked in 1633. This was based on a city map from that year, produced by the copperplate engraver Wenzel Holler. The model itself was constructed between 1955 and 1957 by sculptor and genre painter Heinrich Bohn (1911-1990).

CAMP_test,Start,1,"The CAMP test (Christie–Atkins–Munch-Peterson) is a test to identify group B β-hemolytic streptococci (Streptococcus agalactiae) based on their formation of a substance (CAMP factor) that enlarges the area of hemolysis formed by the β-hemolysin elaborated from Staphylococcus aureus. 


== CAMP factor ==
Although the test is usually used to identify group B streptococcus, there is some evidence that the CAMP factor gene is present in several groups of streptococci, including group A.
A similar factor has been identified in Bartonella henselae.


== Uses ==
The CAMP test can be used to identify Streptococcus agalactiae. Though not strongly beta-hemolytic on its own, group B strep presents with wedge-shaped colonies in the presence of Staphylococcus aureus.
It can also be used to identify Listeria monocytogenes which produces a positive CAMP reaction.


== Setup ==
Streak a beta-lysin–producing strain of aureus down the center of a sheep blood agar plate.
The test organism streak should be 3 to 4 cm long.
Streak test organisms across the plate perpendicular to the S. aureus streak within 2 mm. (Multiple organisms can be tested on a single plate).
Incubate at 35°-37°C in ambient air for 18-24 hours.
Wedge shaped pattern radiating from the test organism near the S. aureus indicates positivity


== Reverse CAMP test ==
The reverse CAMP test is a method to identify Clostridium perfringens using β-hemolytic streptococci. The CAMP factor produced by S. agalactiae and the alpha toxin produced by C. perfringens act synergistically to produce enhanced hemolysis. Streaking these two organisms perpendicular to each other on a blood agar plate will yield a “bow tie” shaped zone of hemolysis which indicates a positive test.


== History ==
CAMP is an acronym for ""Christie–Atkins–Munch-Peterson"", for the three researchers who discovered the phenomenon.
It is often incorrectly reported as the product of four people (counting Munch-Petersen as two people). The true relationship (three people) is the reason for two en dashes and then one hyphen in Christie–Atkins–Munch-Petersen.
The name of the test bears no relationship to the name of the second messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate (commonly referred to as cAMP).

Bedrock_plane,Start,1,"Bedrock is a design of bench planes developed by Stanley Works as an attempt to improve over the Bailey plane design. It was introduced in the early 20th century. 
The main difference of the Bedrock design was in the frog, which holds the blade also known as an iron. A characteristic of the Bailey design is that the frog is secured to the upper side of the sole, and the iron extends unsupported through a slot machined in the sole of the plane. Some claim that this contributes to what is commonly referred to as ""blade chatter"", which is an uneven surface created in the wood. However, nobody to date has been able to replicate this phenomenon intentionally or show that this has anything to do with the way the frog is anchored to the main body of the plane. More likely, it is due to an inexperienced grip on the plane or the work piece not being secured enough, causing it to vibrate. The Bedrock design was made to more precise standards but both frog types can be anchored tight enough to avoid any movement. The Bedrock frog extends through a much larger slot milled in the sole of the plane, providing support to the iron almost to its cutting edge. This combined with a better mounting of the frog to the plane body provides a more solid bedding of the iron to the plane body, hence the name bedrock, yet this has not led to a discernible improvement in performance.
In addition to iron support, another element widely perceived as problematic with the Bailey design is that the frog mounting screws are under the cutting iron, so the cutting iron assembly must be removed if one wishes to adjust the position of the frog. This adjustment is made to vary the opening at the ""mouth"", which refers to the position of the cutting edge in relation to the front of the slot in the sole, and which is supposedly used to control the size of shaving taken by the plane. However, the fact that no vintage planes are ever found with a closed throat indicates that craftsmen of old made use of this feature in extremely rare occasions. The Bedrock design incorporated a new adjustment method in which the entire frog could be wound forward or back, if necessary, thus adjusting the mouth, without removing the blade. 
However, a clear problem with the Bedrocks which nobody seems to address is that the surface between the frog and the sole is not parallel, like on Bailey planes, but at an incline. This means that any adjustment made to open or close the throat also alters the depth of cut, which must be reset before continuing any work.
A similarity between Bedrocks and Baileys is that they both featured thin irons, which are evidently easier to sharpen, since there is less steel to remove. Indeed, on most Stanley irons the functional surface is laminated with hard, wear resistant steel and mild steel in the remainder of the iron. Modern irons from other makers are much thicker, which means more material to remove, and are 100 percent tool steel, hardened to about Rockwell 62. Of course, these are priced at multiple times more than basic Bailey pattern planes which were the preferred option for most craftsmen until the crafts began to disappear.
Since the cheaper Baileys were kept in production along with the Bedrocks, to make the distinction easier, square designs were modelled in the body of the bedrock planes.
Long discontinued, Bedrocks are still sought after mainly by tool collectors but also hobby woodworkers. Although no benefits have been identified, some users prefer to retro-fit thicker irons, which are available to suit most plane types but may require modifications to support the greater thickness behind the cap iron.
No #601 was never produced by Stanley Works, but a ""601"" is indeed available from a custom plane maker. This ""601"" even has a lateral blade adjustment which the #1 never had.

Tinka's_Boy,Start,1,"Tinka's Boy (1989–2022) was a chestnut Dutch Warmblood stallion who competed in show jumping, largely ridden by Swiss equestrian Markus Fuchs. Over an eight-year show career, Tinka's Boy won 26 international Grand Prix events and over 2 million Swiss Francs in prize money. He stood just under 16hh (162cm high at the withers).


== Background ==
Tinka's Boy started his career with British rider Nick Skelton. After winning the 1997 FEI Jumping Nations Cup in Gijon, Tinka's Boy was sold to Isolde Liebherr to be ridden by Markus Fuchs of Switzerland.
In 2000, Fuchs and Tinka's Boy were part of the Swiss showjumping team to take silver medals in the team showjumping competition at the Sydney Olympic Games. The next year, the pair won the 2001 FEI Jumping World Cup Final, displacing reigning champion Rodrigo Pessoa. That same year, Fuchs and Tinka's Boy jumped a clear round at the Aachen Nations Cup Show in Germany, which helped the Swiss team top the leaderboard at the event.
In 2004, Fuchs and Tinka's Boy were selected for the Athens Olympics, and were part of the Swiss team that finished fifth in the showjumping event. Fuchs and Tinka's Boy placed 46th individually, despite being favorites going into the competition. Tinka's Boy made an impression on the Sydney crowds by making an unscheduled stop to defecate before his round. It was usual behavior for the horse prior to a jumping round. Fuchs later said, ""He's always doing this to me...I've asked him a few times but he hasn't given me an answer yet.""
In December 2004, Tinka's Boy suffered an injury while taking part in the jump off at a grand prix event in La Coruña, Spain. It was found later that the horse tore his left front superficial flexor tendon and underwent rehabilitation. After treatment, it was decided he would not be able to return to international competition. 
At the 2006 Gothenburg Horse Show, Tinka's Boy was formally retired in a ceremony where he was unsaddled to a standing ovation from the audience. Upon retirement, Tinka's Boy became a full-time breeding stallion. As a stallion, he was an approved sire by the KWPN (Dutch Warmblood) and by the French Studbook for Selle Francais. Tinka's Boy has over 500 registered descendants. One of his daughters, Tinka's Serenade was ridden by Ireland's Billy Twomey in the 2012 Olympic games.
Tinka's Boy died at age 33 in January 2022 at the Béligneux Le Haras stallion station in France.

National_College_for_DUI_Defense,Start,1,"The National College for DUI Defense (NCDD) is a professional, non-profit corporation dedicated to the improvement of the criminal defense bar, and to the dissemination of information to the public about drunk driving law and related issues.  With almost 1700 attorney members nationwide, the organization consists of a dean, a governing board of regents, a founding membership, a sustaining membership and a general membership, and is headquartered in Montgomery, Alabama.  Additionally, there is a State Delegate selected for each state.


== History and purpose ==
The College was founded in 1994 in Chicago by 12 DUI defense attorneys, who formed the original Board of Regents. Subsequently, each served as dean of the college for one year prior to automatically retiring from the board as a fellow of the National College. As the original board retired, new Regents were brought in to serve.
The college's mission statement states that ""In sum, the mission of the College is to vindicate the promise of the United States Constitution, that a citizen accused has the right to the effective assistance of his or her counsel"". As part of this mission, the College presents seminars to the profession on a regular basis.  These include a 3-day summer session conducted annually at the Harvard Law School since 1995; a 3-day fall seminar in Las Vegas, Nevada, in conjunction with the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers; a spring Mastering Scientific Evidence seminar in New Orleans, and a 2-day winter seminar at changing locations.


== Accreditation ==
In 1999, the college instituted board certification to recognize lawyers within the college who exemplify the program's standards, and who meet the criteria established by the board: extensive experience trying DUI cases and litigating pre-trial issues, a broad knowledge of the science involved in testing for intoxicants, and a command of the legal process on which DUI cases are framed. In 2003, the American Bar Association recognized DUI Defense Law as a specialty area in the practice of law, and awarded its ""Certificate of Accreditation"" to the board certification program. In 2008, the American Bar Association re-accredited the National College's specialty certification program in DUI Defense Law. The NCDD is currently the only organization in the country accredited to certify lawyers as DUI Defense Law specialists.

Port_Jew,Start,1,"The Port Jew concept was formulated by Lois Dubin and David Sorkin in the late 1990s as a social type that describes Jews who were involved in the seafaring and maritime economy of Europe, especially in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Helen Fry suggests that they could be considered to have been ""the earliest modern Jews.""
The concept of the ""Port Jew"" has been suggested as an ""alternate path to modernity"" that was distinct from the European Haskalah.  Port Jews are described as the product of what is characterized as the ""liberal environment"" of port towns and cities.
David Sorkin restricts his definition of the ""port Jew"" to apply only to a very specific group of Sephardi and Italian-Jewish merchants who were participants in the Mediterranean and transatlantic economy of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.


== Origins ==
According to Helen Fry, Port Jews often arrived as ""refugees from the Inquisition"" and the expulsion of Jews from Iberia.  They were allowed to settle in port cities as merchants granted permission to trade in ports such as Amsterdam, London, Trieste and Hamburg.  Fry notes that their connections with the Jewish diaspora and their expertise in maritime trade made them of particular interest to the mercantilist governments of Europe.  Lois Dubin describes Port Jews as Jewish merchants who were ""valued for their engagement in the international maritime trade upon which such cities thrived"". Sorkin and others have characterized the socio-cultural profile of these men as marked by a flexibility towards religion and a ""reluctant cosmopolitanism that was alien to both traditional and ""enlightened"" Jewish identities.""


== Port Jewish families and business in the early modern period ==
Jewish family tradition and strategy was built upon business and safety. Jewish families, as in the case with the Jewish merchant Glikl, married off her children both in nearby cities as well as distant cities for the reason of business and safety. Glikl being a business woman was not uncommon amongst the German Jews. Christian, Italy, and France all differed from Jewish life history in that it was based on ethical will, which included more of a tale of life lessons to be passed on to the children as well as direction on how to proceed after their death. Glikl in writing her memoir focused on analyzing accounts of her life while simultaneously addressing her children. Not only was “Memoirs of Gluckel of Hameln” a rich source for cultural and social history, but it also had unusual literacy structure and religious resonance. In Jewish family culture koved was directly in tune with honesty in business which is also connected to your status, oysher un koved. Glikl prided herself on leaving Hamburg without a bad debt with any Jew or non-Jew. Jewish business failure held huge weight in bringing shame and disgrace to the Jewish name.


=== Port Jewish widows in the early modern period ===
During the early modern period, wives of Port Jew merchants participated in business through their approach of marriage as a business partnership. Cheryl Tallan explains how earlier recordings of Jewish women partaking in their husbands’ business dealings can be witnessed in the case recorded by Rabbi Samson in 1216. During the seventeenth and eighteenth century, women such as Glickl of Hameln, as read in the “Memoirs of Gluckel of Hameln”, (including both her mother and grandmother) participated in their husbands’ business dealings as Port Jews in Hamburg. As was common with many Jewish couples during this period, women had the opportunity to continue their family business after their husbands were deceased. As a widow, they received a dowry from their husband's estate or descendants upon their husbands’ death. Through the dowries, Jewish widows were able to continue their husbands’ business dealings and their children’s marriage proposals through the utilization of the business networks established prior to their husbands’ death.


== Expanded to include Ashkenazi merchants ==
Dubin has proposed that the concept of the ""port Jew"" be expanded to describe ""port Jewry"" which she describes as a particular type of Jewish community that existed in European maritime ports and combined maritime commerce with European and Jewish culture.  This expanded definition would encompass Ashkenazi as well as Sephardi merchants living in other European ports such as Hamburg, Southampton, Portsmouth, and Odessa.

Ronchi_test,Start,1,"In optical testing a Ronchi test is a method of determining the surface shape (figure) of a mirror used in telescopes and other optical devices.


== Description ==
In 1923 Italian physicist Vasco Ronchi published a description of the eponymous Ronchi test, which is a variation of the Foucault knife-edge test and which uses simple equipment to test the quality of optics, especially concave mirrors.  [1]. A ""Ronchi tester"" consists of:

A light source
A diffuser
A Ronchi grating
A Ronchi grating consists of alternate dark and clear stripes.  One design is a small frame with several evenly spaced fine wires attached.
Light is emitted through the Ronchi grating (or a single slit), reflected by the mirror being tested, then passes through the Ronchi grating again and is observed by the person doing the test.  The observer's eye is placed close to the centre of curvature of the mirror under test looking at the mirror through the grating.  The Ronchi grating is a short distance (less than 2 cm) closer to the mirror.
The observer sees the mirror covered in a pattern of stripes that reveal the shape of the mirror. The pattern is compared to a mathematically generated diagram (usually done on a computer today) of what it should look like for a given figure.  Inputs to the program are line frequency of the Ronchi grating, focal length and diameter of the mirror, and the figure required.  If the mirror is spherical, the pattern consists of straight lines.


== Applications ==
The Ronchi test is used in the testing of mirrors for reflecting telescopes especially in the field of amateur telescope making. It is much faster to set up than the standard Foucault knife-edge test.
The Ronchi test differs from the knife-edge test, requiring a specialized target (the Ronchi grating, which amounts to a periodic series of knife edges) and being more difficult to interpret. This procedure offers a quick evaluation of the mirror's shape and condition.  It readily identifies a 'turned edge' (rolled down outer diameter of the mirror), a common fault that can develop in objective mirror making.
The figure quality of a convex lens may be visually tested using a similar principle.  The grating is moved around the focal point of the lens while viewing the virtual image through the opposite side.  Distortions in the lens surface figure then appear as asymmetries in the periodic grating image.

Townswomen's_Guild,Start,1,"The Townswomen's Guild (TG) is a British women's organisation. There are approximately 30,000 members, 706 branches and 77 Federations throughout England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, the Isle of Man and the Isle of Wight. (Figures updated 1 August 2013).
The Townswomen's Guild is the second largest British women's organisation. It consists of local branches, known as guilds, and federations, which are groups of local guilds who work together throughout the UK.
The movement was formed in 1929, at the instigation of Margery Corbett Ashby and Eva Hubback, when all women over 21 won the right to vote and with the aim of educating women about good citizenship.


== Membership and organisational Structure ==
The national headquarters of the Townswomen's Guilds (TG), is in Birmingham, England.


== Hierarchy ==
The Townswomen's Guilds' (TG) Patron is Her Royal Highness The Princess Royal, and the organisation's National President is Dame Diana Brittan DBE. Its National Vice-Presidents are Dame Jocelyn Barrow DBE, Eileen Bell CBE and Baroness Flather.
The Guilds' Honorary Life National Vice-Presidents are Maggie Chilton MBE, Jean Ellerton JP, Marjory Hall OBE, Jean Hunt, Pamela Pollock, Pauline Myers, Sue Smith OBE, Iris Shanahan MBE, Pauline Myers and Margaret Key.
The current National Chairman is Penny Ryan, who leads the board of the National Executive Committee (NEC) in the running the organisation and the staff at the headquarters.


== Awards ==
Every year, members are recognised and awards are presented at the organisation’s Annual General Meeting (AGM). ""Townswoman of the Year"" is an award presented to a member who has devoted their time and energy to the organisation and is chosen by the National Chairman. The ""Officers’ Trophy"" is given to a member who has exceptionally gone ‘above and beyond the call of duty’ to support an organisation or charity and is chosen by the National Executive Committee (NEC).


== Townswoman ==
The Townswomen’s Guilds (TG) produces Townswoman, a magazine for its members which is published quarterly every year - it is delivered directly to all TG members. Townswoman contains a mixture of articles covering all aspects of the organisation and more general features of interest to the members.


== Activities ==
Guilds meet mainly monthly, and their programmes include speakers, demonstrations, social activities and outings. Townswomen also get involved in charitable events, International Women's Day, sports, creative leisure activities, competitions and exhibitions. The Guild tries to influence change, with a focus on public affairs, using the opinions of its members on important issues for the attention of decision-makers.


== History ==
In 1897, the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies was formed and it was led by suffragist Millicent Fawcett and in 1918 some women in Britain got the vote. At this point the National Union of Societies for Equal Citizenship became the new name of the suffragist organisation.
In 1928, all women over the age of 21 were given the vote as a result of the Equal Franchise Act irrespective of their property, education or previous interests. The following year the idea of urban Guilds was launched by Margery Corbett Ashby, for women to meet and learn about citizenship and how to use the vote. The idea was to be based on the successful Women's Institutes, but the new guild was designed to appeal to urban women. The first Guild was opened in Hayward's Heath. Guilds were able to meet and help others locally by forming Federations.
In 1932, the organisation had 146 guilds and it became the National Union of Townswomen's Guilds and Gertrude Horton became its National Secretary. Alice Franklin became the honorary (ie. unpaid) secretary in 1933. The two of them had published a national handbook from the central offices in Cromwell Place in London in 1938. The handbook included regulations and advice on finance and democracy and how to organise a meeting. By 1939 there were 544 guilds established with 54,000 members.
During the Second World War, the central organisation was reduced to just Franklin and Horton. They would shelter from bombing in the cellar, and one night in April 1941, Horton lost four members of her family to a bomb in Hampstead. During the war years, the Government asked the NUTG to encourage War married women who were not eligible for National Service to work locally to release others for war work.
1948 saw reorganisation when Mary Courtney, a new national secretary, was elected. Alice Franklin resigned after a dispute, and Horton was forced out the following year. In the early 1950s, the Guild had over 130,000 members.


== Campaigns ==
Guilds and Federations took the opportunity to join in the Festival of Britain celebrations in 1951, and continued to campaign on national affairs.
In the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, members campaigned on issues such as environmental pollution, mixed-sex wards, nuclear power, food additives, prescription charges and carers' rights.
The National Union of Townswomen's Guilds became Townswomen's Guilds in 1989. The following year, nearly £200,000 was raised to plant trees in six new woods, to help the environment and to replace trees lost in storms in the late 1980s. In the 1990s, members continued campaigning on single person supplements, medicinal cannabis and genetic screening.
In the 2000s, members campaigned on post office closures, parental accountability and human trafficking. The 2010s saw campaigns on empty homes, geriatric care in hospitals, gambling advertising, getting rid of cheques, banning FGM and modern slavery.
In 2014, a new logo was introduced. A TG memorial was commissioned in 2017 for the National Memorial Arboretum.

Estrel_Tower,Start,1,"The Estrel Tower is a 176 m tall skyscraper under construction in the Neukölln district of Berlin, Germany. After its completion in 2024 the building will become Berlin's tallest building and Germany's tallest hotel. 


== History ==
In 2013 the Estrel Hotel started a competition for the realization of a high-rise next to the existing hotel building located on the Sonnenallee. The competition was won by Barkow Leibinger (founded by Frank Barkow and Regine Leibinger) who proposed a series of triangulated volumes resembling the game of Tangram in response to the existing hotel building and the low-rise surrounding neighbourhoods. The proposal included a skyscraper with a sloped silhouette and a roof terrace oriented to the city.
In December 2017 the borough assembly of Neukölln gave its permission for the project. Ekkehard Streletzki, the owner of the Estrel Hotel, adjusted the plans for the exclusive usage as a hotel building during the COVID-19 pandemic to a mixed usage with 525 hotel rooms and 9,000 m2 (97,000 sq ft) of office space. 
The construction started in November 2021. The project aims to earn a LEED Gold certification.

Thank_you,Start,1,"""Thank you"" (often expanded to  thank you very much or thanks a lot, or informally abbreviated to thanks or alternately as many thanks) is a common expression of gratitude in the English language. The term itself originated as a shortened form of the expression ""I thank you"". Children in certain Western cultures are taught early on to say please and thank you reflexively, and the phrase itself has taken on a variety of nuances based on intonation, and can have various generally positive social effects.


== Learning to use the term ==
Use of the phrase indicates politeness, and in certain Western cultures, ""parents put a lot of effort into teaching their children to be polite, to say 'thank you' or 'please' for every single favor done by anyone"", though the practice of quizzing children on what they should say has been criticized as framing the question in a negative context of the child being forgetful, and that the parent should merely remind the child to ""Say please and thank you"".  It has generally been observed that ""parents train their kids to say 'thank you' whether they feel thankful or not"", and has specifically been noted that withholding food from children in order to elicit politeness ""may teach children that the words 'please' and 'thank you' are tokens they must use to get their food rather than genuine expressions of gratitude"".


== Social function ==
Philosopher David J. Gunkel notes that ""[i]t is now common for users to say 'thank you' to their digital assistants and speech dialogue systems (SDS), like Amazon's Echo/Alexa, Google Home, and Apple's Siri"". Gunkel notes that this may appear to be superfluous, since the statement neither offers information to the system for processing, nor is capable of being processed by the system and understood as a command, but concludes that it is nevertheless socially important because it recognizes the system as fulfilling a social function.
Use of the phrase by teachers has been observed to elicit better responses in the teaching of children:

We notice that in the classrooms of effective teachers, the phrase ""thank you"" is uttered often, much more so than in the classrooms of less effective teachers. We also find that in classrooms where teachers use the phrase ""thank you"" often, students also use the phrase more often than they do in the classrooms of less effective teachers.
In other environs, one study found that regular patrons of a restaurant gave bigger tips when servers wrote ""Thank you"" on their checks.
As with various other formal phrases, the phrase ""Thank you"" can be varied in speaking so as to convey many different meanings. For example, ""no, thank you"" or ""no thanks"" are often used to indicate politeness while declining an offer. It can also be incorporated into phrases sarcastically or bitterly, as with the phrase, ""thanks for nothing"". Common responses for ""thank you"" include ""you're welcome"", ""don't mention it"", or, more recently, according to a 2018 HuffPost article, ""no problem"".


== Cultural variations ==
A wide variety of verbal cues for the expression of gratitude exist in different languages. A 2012 Vanity Fair poll indicated that ""thank you"" was the phrase American travelers abroad, especially in east Asian Nations, felt was most important to learn how to say in the language of the country being visited.
It has been observed that in some versions of African English (specifically in Kenyan English), ""thank you"" is often used as a traditional response to a departing person saying ""goodbye"".

Hundertwasserhaus_Plochingen,Start,1,"The Hundertwasser House Plochingen ""Living under the Raintower"" is a house designed by the Austrian artist Friedensreich Hundertwasser (1928-2000) co-designed building in the German City Plochingen. It was built from November 1991 to August 1994.


== Prehistory, Planning, Construction ==
In the 1980s, the centre of Plochingen was redesigned in terms of urban planning. A historical core was created on the market square. The Marktstraße became an pedestrian zone. However, there was a lack of parking spaces, apartments and space for trade and commerce. The Neckarstraße and Schorndorferstraße areas were still lying fallow. Until the early 1990s, the concept of a closed area with an inner courtyard was developed for this area; the inner courtyard was to be public.
With the help of contacts via the Austrian twin town Zwettl, Friedensreich Hundertwasser was won over for the design of the inner courtyard. He also designed the rain tower with the four gold spheres. The ""Rain Tower"" is 33 meters high.
A residential and commercial building with 6,800 m2 living space, 5,500 m2 commercial floor space and a two-storey underground car park was built under a private developer.

WeFarm,Start,1,"Wefarm was a peer-to-peer knowledge sharing social network for smallholder farmers in the developing world. The network enabled users to ask and answer questions and share tips about agriculture and business, via SMS or online, enabling farmers in rural areas without internet access to share information. Wefarm claimed to be the world's largest farmer-to-farmer network. It raised more than $10m in venture capital before going out of business in 2022.


== History ==
Wefarm was developed as a project in 2010 by the Cafédirect Producers Foundation (CPF), a British charity that works to support smallholder tea, coffee, and cocoa farmers and their producer organizations to build innovative, community-driven projects. 
Wefarm was piloted, tested, and developed in 2011 and 2012 as a CPF project with funding from the Nominet Trust. This initial prototype of the system was tested in partnership with smallholder farming organizations in Peru, Kenya, and Tanzania.
In 2012 Wefarm won the Knight News Challenge, run by the Knight Foundation, providing support to build a more robust, scalable version of the proof of concept system. In 2014 Wefarm was an overall winner of the Google Impact Challenge, providing funding to launch Wefarm in several different countries around the world and take it to scale.
In October 2018 Wefarm announced it had reached over 1.1 million users across Kenya, Uganda, and Peru with plans to expand into the rest of Africa in 2019, beginning with Tanzania.


== Technology ==
The service is free to use and only requires a mobile phone to send and receive SMS messages - technology which is tried-and-tested and widely used by farmers in the developing world. Farmers text questions to a local number; Wefarm uses machine learning algorithms to identify the most appropriate responders, and transmits the message to those users with similar interests in the area, who reply. Although the platform also exists online, over 95 percent of users choose to use it offline. Farmers using the service typically receive three to five local answers to their inquiries within a couple of hours, and often farmers from other countries begin to send advice within 24 hours.


== Business model ==
In January 2015 Wefarm was launched as a social enterprise subsidiary of CPF, with a for-profit business model in order to achieve long-term financial sustainability and scalability. Wefarm plans to partner with local, national, and international companies who want to increase sustainability and transparency in their supply chains and access isolated farming markets.

Stomacher_(jewellery),Start,1,"A stomacher - sometimes called a devant de corsage - is a piece of jewellery worn on the centre panel of the bodice of a dress, which is itself also called a stomacher. In the 18th and 19th century, stomachers became large, eye-catching pieces of jewellery to be worn with formal court robes or ball gowns. Like the tiara, it was a jewel pre-eminently suited to expressing social status.


== Description ==
A stomacher is worn on the centre panel of the bodice of a dress, which itself is also called stomacher. 
A stomacher can consist of one or more elements.  If it consists of one element, it can be best described as a large and elaborate brooch to be worn at the top of the bodice, in the centre of the neckline. A stomacher that consists of more than one element often has the overall shape of an inverted triangle: the element to be worn at the neckline is widest, with the lower elements tapering downwards towards the waist and covering the entire centre panel of the bodice. The elements can usually also be worn individually.
Ever since the Renaissance, the centre panels of bodices were adorned with precious stones and pearls that were sewn onto the fabric. The stomacher as a detacheable piece of jewellery became popular in the second half of the 18th century, and was in fashion until the beginning of the 20th century. It was mainly worn with ball gowns or ceremonial gowns for events at court. Stomachers were made of gold, silver or platinum and richly decorated with precious stones and pearls. Because of its weight, a large stomacher could only be worn if the bodice of the gown was corsetted. In some countries, a similar, but simpler, piece of jewellery is part of the traditional folk costume. 

A stomacher could be part of a parure, a set of jewellery with the same design. Stomachers went out of fashion at the beginning of the 20th century. Nowadays, an antique stomacher (or one of its elements) is occasionally worn as a brooch with an evening gown. It is then usually worn on the shoulder or on the belt, and not on the neckline.

Prime Minister David Cameron has said the program was inspired by the Peace Corps. The forerunner programme to ICS was Platform2, which was initiated under the previous Labour government.
ICS and ICS Entrepreneur are led by VSO in partnership with a group of development organisations.
Volunteers to the ICS are asked to fundraise, and receive support to help them meet their fundraising goals.
The programme has been on pause since the Covid-19 pandemic.


== ICS consortium ==

The ICS consortium are a group of organisations that aim to use their experience in running overseas volunteer programmes to work towards the Sustainable Development Goals. Collectively, the ICS agencies work directly with around 3000 international volunteers every year and have partnerships in over 60 countries. While a number of agencies ran volunteer programmes as part of ICS by 2020, only three agencies were still part of the consortium; Raleigh International, VSO and Restless Development.


== Criticisms ==
The International Citizen Service was criticized for a lack of value and basically providing holidays on taxpayers expense. Questions have been raised as to whether the cost of £7,633 per volunteer for the flights, visas, accommodation, food, insurance, a certain amount of living expenses and training of young people offers good value for money. The same report showed however that those volunteers raised £2.148 million to support the programmes during that period which covered the majority of that cost.

ROV_SuBastian,Start,1,"The Remote Operated Vehicle (ROV) SuBastian is owned and operated by the Schmidt Ocean Institute and is used for scientific exploration of the deep sea. ROV SuBastian is operated from the Schmidt Ocean Institute's research vessel RV Falkor and can reach depths up to 4,500m (2.8 miles). The tethered robot has an array of scientific capability which includes: 

Deploying and recovering scientific equipment
Photomosaicing
Sample collection
Seawater characterization
Seafloor mapping
4k High-resolution video
ROV SuBastian is an adaptable system and additional sensors and scientific instruments can be mounted onto the ROV based on a science party’s specific research goals.


== History ==
ROV SuBastian was named after the character Bastian from the German fantasy novel The Neverending Story (Bastian) combined with “sub,” as the vehicle is used subsurface. ROV SuBastian operates solely from R/V Falkor.
ROV SuBastian was specifically designed and constructed for scientific research in 2015 by a California-based team of engineers. The design and construction process took approximately 18 months. SuBastian was tank tested at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute prior to its first deep sea launch. The inaugural dive occurred in 2016 in the deep sea off Guam. As of 2020, ROV SuBastian has completed over 400 dives around the globe, enabling researcher’s access to remote regions and depths. Researchers utilizing ROV SuBastian have discovered new species, seafloor features, and advanced scientific exploration of the global ocean.


== Specifications ==
ROV SuBastian weighs 3,200kg and is 2.7m x 1.8m x 1.8m, roughly the same size as a subcompact car. The vehicle is fitted with syntactic foam, allowing it to be neutrally buoyant while diving. SuBastian moves using five thrusters; one thruster moves it sideways, two move it forward and back, and another two are used for vertical movement. It is tethered to Falkor with a highly flexible and robust umbilical cable, which provides electrical and optical signals between the ship and ROV. The umbilical uses a cantilever system to avoid entanglement with propellers. ROV SuBastian transits at a speed of 0.5 – 3 knots, depending on depth and currents. Once deployed, ROV SuBastian is controlled by at least two pilots aboard the ship. The dive length depends on objective, depth, and weather. The average dive time is around 8 hours, but there are no technical limits on how long an ROV can stay down.

Cambrian_House,Start,1,"Cambrian House began as a crowdsourcing community that pioneered the technology to tap crowds for the best software ideas. To power open innovation in other businesses, they developed a crowdsourcing platform Chaordix – the technology to harness a crowd for breakthrough ideas.


== Results ==
Launched in 2006, the original Cambrian House community attracted 50,000+ members and more than 7000 ideas from the crowd.
Weaknesses in the idea-community model included the challenge of convincing users to read and rate a rapidly growing pool of ideas, the relatively low quality of some ideas, the management complexity of distributed development, and the large number of duplicate submissions. These weaknesses have been successfully overcome by other companies including InnoCentive, IStockphoto, and T-shirt design company Threadless.


== In the news ==
Cambrian House has been discussed, primarily in relation to crowdsourcing in a variety of media including: CBC Radio's - The Current, The Financial Times and Economist Intelligence Unit, in addition to new media such as TechDigest and Mashable.
Cambrian House is also the subject of an eponymous Harvard Business case, which examines and discusses the concept of peer production, the crowdsourcing business model, and the possibility of using prediction markets to estimate market demand for products.

Battle_of_Podgora,Start,1,"The Battle of Podgora was a battle between Italian and Austro-Hungarian forces during World War I on the Italian front.
Podgora, also known as Monte Calvario in Italian and Kalvarija in Slovenian, was a key defensive position for the Austro-Hungarian forces during the early battles of the Isonzo, protecting the strategic city of Gorizia. Heavily fortified with trenches, barbed wire, and machine-gun posts, it was supported by artillery on the peaks.
On 19 June 1915, Italian forces launched an attack, initially targeting the Austro-Hungarian trenches with artillery fire. Despite intense resistance and heavy casualties, the Italian Carabinieri managed to advance but were ultimately halted. Subsequent reinforcements failed to secure further gains, and heavy losses led to the cessation of the attack. The battle ended with significant casualties for the Italians, who eventually captured Podgora during the Sixth Battle of the Isonzo, leading to the conquest of Gorizia on 6 August 1916.


== Background ==
Podgora, also known as Monte Calvario in Italian and Kalvarija in Slovenian, was one of the main bulwarks of the Austro-Hungarian defense of the strategically important city of Gorizia during the early battles of the Isonzo. It was heavily fortified with multiple lines of trenches, barbed wire and machine-gun posts. Further protection was provided by the Austro-Hungarian artillery positioned on the peaks.


== The Battle ==
On 19 June 1915 at 10:20am the attack began with the 75 mm battery hitting the Austro-Hungarian trenches on the left where the machine guns were located. At 11:00am, the 8th Company, under the command of Captain Vallaro, jumped from the trench, followed 30 meters by Lieutenant Losco's 7th and, another 30 metres, by Captain Lazari's 9th. The Carabinieri immediately came under intense Austro-Hungarian fire which slowed down until it halted the advance of the 7th Company, which was soon left without its commander, who was mortally wounded (Lieutenant Losco would be remembered as the first Carabinieri officer to die in battle during the first world War). Some elements of the 8th Company managed to overtake their comrades from the 7th, settling close to the enemy fences. The 9th Company managed to advance to where the 7th and 8th had already been stopped despite suffering heavy casualties which including their commanding officer Captain Lazari who was seriously wounded. Once the survivors had reorganised, a new bayonet attack was launched which brought the Carabinieri a few meters from the enemy fences, in a fold of ground. But the action was costly and the position proved to be very precarious, so much so that after a few minutes, among others, lieutenant colonel Pranzetti and lieutenants Parziale and Struffi were wounded. The heavy losses prevented the 3rd Battalion from continuing the action so at 13:00 the 4th and 5th companies of the 2nd Battalion went into action. The intense enemy fire, however, allowed only a few elements to reunite with the survivors of the 3rd Battalion: among the first wounded were lieutenants De Dominicis and Ciuffoletti. The 2nd battalion of the 36th Infantry Regiment also intervened in support, but was unable to advance. Meanwhile, on the left, the Austro-Hungarians had repelled an attack by the 1st Infantry Regiment, and managed to gain a favorable position to strike the Carabinieri from behind.
Given the deteriorating situation, the Carabinieri were ordered to settle as best they could on the positions they had captured at such a high cost and prepare to defend against a possible Austro-Hungarian counterattack. It was also planned to renew the attack with the support of the 2nd battalion of the 36th Infantry Regiment. However, a few minutes before the appointed time the order was revoked by the command of the VI Army Corps because, in consideration of the losses already suffered, it was deemed necessary to prepare for the new attack with more effective artillery fire.


== Aftermath ==
At a height of 240m at 18:00, the wounded were cleared away. Taking advantage of the darkness of the night, some volunteer Carabinieri took care of the recovery and burial of the fallen. The day ended with 53 dead, 143 wounded and 11 missing. Podgora would later be captured by the infantry of the Casale brigade (11th and 12th Infantry Regiment) during the Sixth Battle of the Isonzo, which would lead to the conquest of Gorizia on 6 August 1916.

Cambridge_SoundWorks,Start,1,"Cambridge SoundWorks was a Massachusetts-based consumer audio manufacturer and retailer.


== History ==
Cambridge SoundWorks was co-founded in 1988 by Henry Kloss, an audio engineer and businessman, and colleague Tom DeVesto. Kloss had founded or co-founded a number of earlier loudspeaker and consumer audio companies, including Acoustic Research, KLH and Advent Corporation.
It was founded with the specific mission to design and manufacture well-priced, high quality, high performance loudspeakers and audio products to be marketed directly to the consumer.  From its inception, the company's success was significant and its products received critical acclaim.
Cambridge SoundWorks began offering its products (such as the Ensemble I, II, and III satellite speaker systems) by catalog and multi-page magazine advertisements. In 1991, the company opened its first retail location in Newton, Massachusetts. In 1994 it sold its first products on the Internet, using the CompuServe network. This made it one of the first companies to sell consumer electronics on the Internet.
The unique selling formula developed in its first store proved successful and eventually spawned the opening of 30 showrooms in New England and metropolitan San Francisco.
In 1997 Cambridge Soundworks was bought by then Creative Labs.
Eventually, Cambridge SoundWorks manufactured over 60 different models of home stereo, home theater, multimedia speakers and assorted electronics products. Its products were designed in California, with Research and Development and Acoustic Engineering in Massachusetts. These products, along with other major brands of high-performance audio and video components, were sold through an online store.
As of February 2018, the Cambridge Soundworks website redirects to theoontz.com, where a product line of portable bluetooth speakers is sold.


== From 2020 ==
As of 2008, all Cambridge SoundWorks retail showrooms are closed. The company continued to manufacture loudspeakers for home theater and multimedia applications, as well as distribute other brands such as Sony and Marantz. Cambridge SoundWorks marketing also included catalog and internet sales, in addition to worldwide product distribution by partnerships with IBM, Gateway, and the parent company Creative Technology Ltd. Creative ordered Cambridge to reduce the number of products sold under its trademark. It has subsequently gone through to newer owners.

Slough_of_Despond,Start,1,"The Slough of Despond ( or ; ""swamp of despair"") is a fictional, deep bog in John Bunyan's allegory The Pilgrim's Progress, into which the protagonist Christian sinks under the weight of his sins and his sense of guilt for them.
It is described in the text:

This miry Slough is such a place as cannot be mended; it is the descent whither the scum and filth that attends conviction for sin doth continually run, and therefore is it called the Slough of Despond: for still as the sinner is awakened about his lost condition, there ariseth in his soul many fears, and doubts, and discouraging apprehensions, which all of them get together, and settle in this place; and this is the reason of the badness of this ground.
The ""Slough of Despond"" may have been inspired by Squitch Fen, a wet and marshy area near his cottage in Harrowden, Bedfordshire, which Bunyan had to cross on his way to church in Elstow, or ""The Souls' Slough"" on the Great North Road between Tempsford and Biggleswade.


== Allusions in other literature ==

This phrase has been referred to frequently in subsequent literature. Nathaniel Hawthorne's tale The Celestial Railroad is a satirical contrast between Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress and Hawthorne's perception of the current state of society. In Emily Brontë's Wuthering Heights the character Mr. Heathcliff likens his son's state of depression to having been dropped ""into a Slough of Despond"".  In George Gissing's New Grub Street, Milvain expresses concern for his friend Reardon's mental health, ""His friends should exert themselves to raise him out of this fearful slough of despond"".  Friedrich Engels in his preface of 1886 to the English edition of Das Kapital, Volume I wrote ""The decennial cycle of stagnation, prosperity, over-production and crisis, ..., seems indeed to have run its course; but only to land us in the slough of despond of a permanent and chronic depression."" In Horatio Hornblower: The Even Chance, by C. S. Forester, Midshipman Archie Kennedy describes Hornblower's new home as ""His Majesty's ship of the line Justinian, known elsewise among her intimates as the good ship Slough of Despond.""  In Mary McCarthy's novel The Group (1954), ""Kay saw that [her husband, Harald] was sinking into a Slough of Despond (as they termed his sudden, Scandinavian fits of depression)"".
In Michael Ende's novel The Neverending Story (1979) there's a place in Fantastica called The Swamps of Sadness. It's a desolate marshland filled with muddy pits resembling quicksand. If one falls into despair while there, they sink deeper into sadness until they are overwhelmed and drowned by it.
W. Somerset Maugham alludes to the Slough in his book Of Human Bondage, where in a letter to the protagonist, Philip Carey, the failed poet Cronshaw details that he has ""hopelessly immersed [himself ... in] the Slough of Despond,"" referring to his poverty. In Gerald Brom's novel, The Child Thief, The Slough is a passage of terror into the world Avalon, which Peter must travel through. In John Steinbeck's novel, Sweet Thursday (1954), Mack describes Doc's melancholic condition in suggesting that his fellow denizens of the Palace Flophouse help him out, using a punning conflation of slang and Bunyan: ""Gentlemen [...] let us highly resolve to get Doc's ass out of the sling of despond"" (79). In Harlan Ellison's short story ""I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream"" (1967), the last five surviving humans are tortured by a godlike artificial intelligence named AM. The narrator relates how, among other harrowing experiences, ""We passed through the Slough of Despond."" In Louisa May Alcott's Hospital Sketches, a grateful Tribulation Periwinkle remarks that she feels ""as did poor Christian [...] on the safe side of the Slough of Despond"", and in her novel Jo's Boys, the titular character Jo's son Ted is said to be prone to ""moods of gloom, and [falls] into the Slough of Despond about once a week"". In Charles Portis's memoir Combinations of Jacksons (1999), he observes that his local dark marsh where he frolicked as a boy wasn't big enough or distinctive enough to have a proper name such as the Slough of Despond, sadly it was just ""the slew"".  In J. G. Farrell's Booker Prize winner, The Siege of Krishnapur (1973), the haunted Padre refers to a particularly dangerous crossing thus:

The Padre was looking more haggard and wild-eyed than ever. He had thought that he would never be able to reach the banqueting hall because he had had to cross the stretch of open lawn swept by musket fire and grape which lay between the Church and the hall and which he had thought of as the Slough of Despond.

SEBAL,Start,1,"The Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) uses the '''surface''' energy balance to estimate aspects of the hydrological cycle. SEBAL maps evapotranspiration, biomass growth, water deficit and soil moisture. Its main creator is Prof. Dr. W.G.M. Bastiaanssen 


== Model background ==
The basis of SEBAL is the energy balance: the energy driving the hydrological cycle is equal to the incoming energy minus:

the energy going to heating of the soil and air, and
the energy reflected back to space.
SEBAL quantifies the energy balance using satellite data as an input.  Land surface characteristics such as surface albedo, leaf area index, vegetation index and surface temperature are derived from satellite imagery. In addition to satellite images, the SEBAL model requires meteorological data, such as wind speed, humidity, solar radiation and air temperature. It uses meteorological data from the moment of the recording of the satellite data to solve the 'instantaneous' energy balance, and uses extrapolation to calculate daily evapotranspiration. Using a time series of satellite and meteorological data, periodic cumulative (e.g. weekly, monthly, yearly) evapotranspiration data can be calculated.
The SEBAL model uses the energy balance, as opposed to in hydrology common water balance to solve for evapotranspiration.


== Applications ==
The energy balance applies to all scales, ranging from global to river basin to region to farm and to field level. Satellite images come in a wide variety of spatial and temporal resolutions. Evapotranspiration and biomass production are key indicators for water management and irrigation performance.
The combination of the energy balance with input from remote sensing data is applied by farmers, irrigation districts, catchment management agencies and regional and national governments.

World's_Finest_Shows,Start,1,"World's Finest Shows is the largest traveling carnival in Ontario, Canada. They are best known for providing a majority of the rides at the Central Canada Exhibition before its cancellation. They generally provide rides and equipment for fairs between 2 and 5 days long. Some events last over a week long. Their typical season runs from late-April to mid-October.


== History ==
World's Finest Shows began in 1986 as a division of Conklin Shows, along with Supershows and the Bicycle Unit. In 1992, the division split off into its own company with Barry Jamieson becoming the president. The newly formed company bought out the assets and contracts of the Conklin eastern road show. The show remained based in Simcoe, Ontario with the barns at the fairgrounds used for storage and a workshop in the winter months. Needing a workshop for the company, they purchased a vacant workshop in Nanticoke, Ontario, which has been home to the show ever since. In 1997, World's Finest Shows won the contract for the Central Canada Exhibition in Ottawa (Commonly known as the Ottawa SuperEx).
When World's Finest Shows began, it had three units. It had the Trillium Unit, Talbot Unit, and the Supershow. The Supershow was a 10-ride rental service that lasted until mid-2002, when it was purchased by Dave and Jimmy Kong and turned into a full-time show. The Trillium Unit acts as the show's main unit, hosting the show's best equipment. The Talbot Unit is a smaller unit, that mostly consists of small, easy to set up rides for smaller events.
Throughout 2006 and 2007, World's Finest Shows sold many of their older rides to help pay off Canada's first Venetian Swing Carousel manufactured by Bertazzon, as well as to purchase three other rides: Fireball, Haunted Mansion, and Monkey Maze. The Venetian Swing Carousel, renamed ""Wave Swinger,"" was first seen at the 2007 Central Canada Exhibition in Ottawa.
In August 2010, World's Finest Shows had qualified as a certified member of the OABA Circle of Excellence, the only midway provider in Canada to be awarded this designation.
After the cancellation of the Central Canada Exhibition in 2011, the company began to downsize to save money. In 2011, they sold their iconic Mack ""Polar Express"" for a smaller ""Musik Express"" model manufactured by Majestic Manufacturing. 2011 also saw the selling of their smaller ferris wheel, and Zamperla ""Circus Train"". They continued to downsize throughout the next few years, selling off their ""Monkey Maze"" funhouse, Chance ""Zipper"",  their Bertazzon ""Wave Swinger"" Swing Carousel, and their old Sellner ""Tilt-A-Whirl"".

Fake_passport,Start,1,"A fake passport is a counterfeit of a passport (or other travel document) issued by a nation or authorised agency. Such counterfeits are copies of genuine passports, or illicitly modified genuine passports made by unauthorized persons, sometimes called cobblers. Its purpose is to be used deceptively as if it were a legitimate travel or identity document. A passport obtained from an authorized issuer by providing false information may also be considered fake.
Such falsified passports can be used to leave a country from which exit is barred, for identity theft, age fabrication, illegal immigration, and organized crime.
Other comparable documents include camouflage passports, which are not copies of a valid form of document, but are designed to look like a passport issued by a body that cannot issue legitimate passports, such as ""Republic of Mainau"", or a ""Baltic Trade Mission"" diplomatic document. Fantasy passports, such as the World Passport, are passport-like documents issued by non-official organizations or micronations as a novelty or souvenir, to make a political statement, or to show loyalty to a political or other cause.

Adolf Eichmann (high-ranking Nazi often referred to as ""the architect of the Holocaust"") after the end of World War II traveled to Argentina using a fraudulently obtained laissez-passer issued by the International Red Cross and lived there under a false identity.
Alexander Solonik (Russian hitman in the early 1990s) lived in Greece with a fake passport, which he had obtained from the Greek consulate in Moscow.
In October 2000, Alexander Litvinenko (Russian dissident and writer) fled to Turkey from Ukraine on a forged passport using the alias Chris Reid, as his actual passport was impounded by Russian authorities after criminal charges were filed against him.
In May 2001, Kim Jong-nam, the son of North Korean leader Kim Jong-il,  was arrested at Narita International Airport, in Tokyo, Japan, travelling on a fake Dominican Republic passport. He was detained by immigration officials and later deported to the People's Republic of China. The incident caused Kim Jong-il to cancel a planned visit to China due to the embarrassment caused by the incident.
In June 2005, American actor Wesley Snipes was detained in South Africa at Johannesburg International Airport for allegedly trying to pass through the airport with a fake South African passport. Snipes was allowed to return home because he had a valid U.S. passport.

Ruger_Security-9,Start,1,"The Ruger Security-9 is a 9mm caliber semi-automatic pistol announced by Sturm, Ruger & Co. on November 22, 2017.


== History ==
Introduced in late 2017, Ruger intended to use the Security-9 to replace the Ruger SR-Series. The Security-9 managed to be even less expensive than the SR-Series as it eliminated the adjustable backstrap and ambidextrous magazine release, used an internal hammer-fired mechanism instead of a striker-fired mechanism and hardened aluminum alloy rails instead of steel rails. The Security-9 was primarily aimed at the affordable handgun demographic.


== Design ==
The design and internal hammer action of the Security-9 pistol are derived from firearms first produced by Kel-Tec (such as the P11) circa 1995.   
The trigger on the Security-9, despite its hybrid single- and double-action nature, is relatively light. Ruger calls this mechanism the ""Secure Action"" design, and it combines the trigger pull of the LCP with single-action, as it has a positive reset. It also has a hammer that provides a strong ignition force that has a slide racking to make it much easier to slide. The pistol also features a sight system with drift adjustable rear sight and a fixed front sight. The strong spring tension and a hammer catch help prevent the hammer from contacting the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled. A horizontal pin must be pushed out of the frame in order to separate the slide from the frame. The trigger does not need to be pulled prior to disassembly.
The Ruger Security-9, like the Ruger American Pistol and the SR-Series, has a polymer frame made out of glass-filled nylon. The Security-9 comes with 15 round magazines and will function with SR-Series magazines. (Ruger also offers 17-round magazines.) Security-9 magazines will also function in the Ruger SR9c. The Ruger Security-9 does not have the ambidextrous mechanisms of the SR-Series. However, it has features that the full-sized SR9 did not, including front cocking serrations and a standard Picatinny rail for accessories.


== Variants ==
When they were first introduced in 2017, the Security-9 model was offered with 15 or 10 round magazines, and certain models came from the factory with a Viridian E-Series Red Laser on the accessory rail. The pistol is also available with a pre-installed Hogue wraparound rubber grip.
In 2019, Ruger introduced the Security-9 Compact. Designed for concealed carry, the Compact model features a shorter slide, shorter barrel, and overall smaller frame. The Compact takes 10-round magazines. 
Also in 2019, Ruger introduced the Security-9 Pro series. The Pro models are a higher-end version of the standard Security-9 and Security-9 Compact, but feature factory-installed steel tritium night sights and no manual thumb safety.
Ruger also offers the Security-9 in different colors: Davidson's Flat Dark Earth, Black, TALO Turquoise, Sports South Silver, RSR Group Cobalt, Big Rock Sports Coyote Brown, Davidson's Battleworn Flag, Lipsey's Flat Dark Earth Frame(Black slide).

The_Fullarton,Start,1,"The Fullarton is a performing arts theatre and entertainment venue in the town of Castle Douglas in the historical county of Kirkcudbrightshire in Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland.
Before the acquisition and opening of The Fullarton (then Lochside Theatre) in 1990, Castle Douglas had previously only one theatre called the Little Theatre, in an old army hut run by the Unity Players. It was closed in the 1970s due to a failure in requirements to run safely as a theatre. In 1984, the late Donald Fullarton, (whose daughter Morag Fullarton is a theatre and television director [1] ), a member of the Scottish Community Drama Association subsequently formed the Galloway Arts Project with the help of local amateur dramatics clubs.
The former St Andrew's Church became available in the 1990s, and was subsequently purchased by the project and funding was provided by both the  Stewartry District Council and the Dumfries and Galloway Regional Council. In the mid 1990s, further major funds were provided by the newly founded National Lottery and opened as a functioning theatre in 1996.
The theatre was refurbished in 2013 in order to meet changing requirements for performance spaces, and was changed from the Lochside Theatre to The Fullarton Theatre in tribute to Donald Fullarton.
Currently, it holds performances, conferences and also is used as a local cinema. It is also used by the member clubs of the Scottish Community Drama Association, most recently holding the SCDA One-Act Western Divisional Festival in March 2018.

Video_Justice,Start,1,"Video Justice is a reality television primetime program (also known as a documentary) produced by John Langley airing on the television cable station truTV and is part of network's truTV RED lineup. The program focuses on criminals who were captured on camera in the act of the crime. The crimes are often ""life or death"" situations that may involve one of the two parties, either law enforcement or the criminals, being killed or seriously injured. It often displays pictures of the suspect in most of its footage and tells the viewer the name of that suspect who of which committed that crime and describes their punishment. The primetime show runs for 30 minutes.
Cameras used in the footage in Video Justice include dashboard cameras, spy cameras, news cameras, and others taped by various people, sometimes including criminals themselves.


== The Show ==
The basic idea of the show is that is proves that you don't need a witness of the crime after the crime, proving that the video tells all or most of the details. as well as the officer's most powerful and essential tool within the war against crime. Most of the footage shown is actual shocking police moments, while other crimes are bizarre.
Video Justice also proves that the video camera is powerful and plays a serious role in these kinds of crimes and proves useful as evidence.


=== Show Connections ===
Some of the footage shown is the same footage seen in Most Shocking, explaining the same information, usually with clearer explanations. The suspects' mugshots shown are the same as the ones in Most Shocking, as well as some of the police that tell the stories.


== Production ==
Video Justice by John Langley...creator of COPS made its debut on Court TV in the April 26, 2006, and has returned for a second season on Court TV beginning January 19, 2007. Currently, there is no known information on future episodes and is currently on hiatus.
A Video Justice-related special known as Video Justice; Crime caught on tape which sometimes airs on Spike TV is one hour long.
In the UK, Video Justice is currently being shown on ITV4.

LBC_Express,Start,1,"LBC Express, Inc. (previously known as Luzon Brokerage Corporation) (PSE: LBC) is a courier company based in the Philippines.
It operates scheduled commercial vehicle cargo services in currently and planned cargo airline services begin on May 31, 2014. As of 2016, LBC has over 1,252 branches in the Philippines, and over 60 branches in the United States and Canada. It also has branches in Hong Kong, Australia, Brunei, Malaysia, Singapore, Japan, Germany, United Arab Emirates, Spain, Kuwait, South Korea and Taiwan.


== History ==
Luzon Brokerage Corporation was founded by Carlos Araneta of the Araneta family in the 1945 as a brokerage firm. With the help of his sons Juan Carlos, Santiago, and Fernando, Carlos Araneta expanded their family-owned business into an air cargo agency and later as a forwarding service provider to clients. As a third-party shipping provider, the company is responsible for dispatching shipments via asset-based carriers, and arranges shipment space for their customers. The company continued to expand their logistic services in 1973 and introduced the 24-hour overnight delivery services in the country later on.
In 1985, the first branch of LBC outside the country was established in San Francisco, California, in the United States. Along with the opening of its US-based branch, the company introduced the famous “Balikbayan Box” and their money remittance service to cater to Overseas Filipino Workers (OFW).
The moniker ""Hari ng padala""  was created by the company in 1990. Products such as Branch Pick-up and Bills Payment were added in 2005, while the more secure mail service for personal documents, loose cargo, and container loads were introduced in 2010. The company also began to target business owners.


=== Advertising controversy ===
The company gained controversy in 2009 for an advertisement depicting a spelling bee where a child spells out the initials ""L-B-C"" for ""remittance"", ""affordable"", and ""instant"". Then-Department of Education secretary Jesli Lapus expressed disappointment over the advertisement, and urged the company to pull the commercial which has earned a ""negative reaction from public for conveying a wrong message."" Expressing concern over television's effects on children, Lapus further stressed that there are alternatives to further develop brand recognition, stating ""The method used in this particular LBC advertisement may have unintended adverse consequences on the education of young televiewers"" and ""would certainly not contribute"" to the education of young students.


== Branding ==
The company silently re-branded in 2013.
The company has also introduced a new slogan, ‘We like to move it’ – which is inspired by the song ""I Like to Move It"" by American dance music band Reel 2 Real. 


== Sponsorships ==
The company has sponsored various sports events, personalities and teams in the Philippines.

Vented_balance_safety_enclosure,Start,1,"Vented balance safety enclosures are used in pharmaceutical, chemical, biological, and toxicological laboratories to provide maximum containment for weighing operations in weighing scales.
Fume hoods, also known as laboratory chemical hoods, are one of the most important and widely used engineering controls to protect workers in laboratories. Fume hoods were introduced about 100 years ago to safeguard personnel working with hazardous materials. While many changes and improvements have been made, the basic concept and design of fume hoods remains the same. Air is drawn from the workplace, around the worker and into the front of the hood, and is then exhausted out of the laboratory.  Most laboratory hoods are described as constant air volume (CAV) hoods because they draw a constant amount of air at all times. Rising energy costs have made these hoods exceptionally expensive to operate. For example, a single six-foot hood operating 24/7/365 costs over $5,000/year to operate. In addition, CAV hoods do not react rapidly to airflow disturbances (turbulence) within the hood or within the laboratory and, hence, their sole purpose of containment and protection can be seriously compromised.
To optimize the effectiveness of properly designed hoods:

Maximize capture and containment of hazardous materials
Use ergonomic design to enable easy use
Conform to high performance standards
Minimize energy consumption
Ensure flexibility to permit quick and easy relocation
The control of hazards is more than simply enclosing the problem. What are important are how well the ventilated areas contain the hazards and suitability of the workstations for the specific tasks being performed.

Cognitively_Guided_Instruction,Start,1,"Cognitively Guided Instruction is ""a professional development program based on an integrated program of research on (a) the development of students' mathematical thinking; (b) instruction that influences that development; (c) teachers' knowledge and beliefs that influence their instructional practice; and (d) the way that teachers' knowledge, beliefs, and practices are influenced by their understanding of students' mathematical thinking"". CGI is an approach to teaching mathematics rather than a curriculum program. At the core of this approach is the practice of listening to children's mathematical thinking and using it as a basis for instruction. Research based frameworks of children's thinking in the domains of addition and subtraction, multiplication and division, base-ten concepts, multidigit operations, algebra, geometry and fractions provide guidance to teachers about listening to their students. Case studies of teachers using CGI have shown the most accomplished teachers use a variety of practices to extend children's mathematical thinking. It's a tenet of CGI that there is no one way to implement the approach and that teachers' professional judgment is central to making decisions about how to use information about children's thinking.  
The research base on children' mathematical thinking upon which CGI is based shows that children are able to solve problems without direct instruction by drawing upon informal knowledge of everyday situations. For example, a study of kindergarten children showed that young children can solve problems involving what are normally considered advanced mathematics such as multiplication, division, and multistep problems, by using direct modeling. Direct modeling is an approach to problem solving in which the child, in the absence of more sophisticated knowledge of mathematics, constructs a solution to a story problem by modeling the action or structure. For example, about half of the children in a study of kindergartners' problem solving were able to solve this multistep problem, which they had never seen before, using direct modeling: 19 children are taking a mini-bus to the zoo.  They will have to sit either 2 or 3 to a seat.  The bus has 7 seats.  How many children will have to sit three to a seat, and how many can sit two to a seat?

Example: Fred had six marbles at school. On the way home from school his friend Joey gave him some more marbles. Now Fred has eleven marbles. How many marbles did Joey give to Fred?
Students may solve this problem by counting down from eleven or by counting up from six. With the use of manipulatives students would be able to represent their thoughts for this problem multiple ways. For instance, they might make a row of six counting blocks next to a row of eleven counting blocks and then compare the difference.
The CGI philosophy is detailed in Children's Mathematics which is co-authored by Thomas Carpenter, Elizabeth Fennema, Megan Loef Franke, Linda Levi, and Susan Empson.

Kaisermarsch,Start,1,"The Kaisermarsch (Imperial March) is a patriotic march composed by Richard Wagner in 1871 in order to exalt the foundation of the German Empire after the victorious Franco-Prussian War.


== History ==
The victory in the Franco-Prussian War and the consequent proclamation of William I, King of Prussia, as German Emperor spurred patriotism and incited several German composers to write patriotic music dedicated to the nation and the new empire. Johannes Brahms, for example, wrote his Song of Triumph (op. 55) in 1871.
Wagner, already known for his musical patriotism in several of his operas, hence composed the Kaisermarsch which entailed both positive and negative reviews but did not succeed in attaining a more prominent status with regard to official ceremonies celebrating the newly achieved victory. Wagner wrote:

After the return of our victorious army, I made private inquiries in Berlin whether, in case a grand ceremonial in honour of the fallen soldiers were projected, I could be permitted to provide a piece suited to such a solemn occasion. But I was told that it was not considered desirable to make special provision for painful impressions to accompany the joyous return of the army. I proposed, still privately, another piece, which was to accompany the entrance of the army, and into which, at the close, — say in defiling before the victorious monarch, — the excellent vocal corps of the Prussian army might join with some popular melody. But this would have necessitated serious changes in the arrangements that had been completed long before, and I was dissuaded from my project. Consequently, I arranged my Kaisermarsch for the concert-hall, for which let it be adapted as well as may be.
Wagner's estranged friend Friedrich Nietzsche wrote derisively of the work, that ""to Wagner's Kaisermarsch, not even the young German Kaiser [i.e. Wilhelm II] could march"".


== Text ==
The text of the march did not become popular, and is rarely sung when the Imperial March is performed nowadays. The main reason for this is the low quality of the text, which emanates from the fact that it was written after the composition of the tune and thus had to be ""trimmed"" in order to fit the melody.


== Patriotic Wagnerian Music ==
Another patriotic piece by Wagner is Hans Sachs′s final monologue in Die Meistersinger when he warns his fellow Germans to protect German culture from foreign influence:

In the third act of Lohengrin, King Henry praises the Germans of Brabant and their will to defend the Empire against Hungarian attacks:

Cambiata,Start,1,"Cambiata, or nota cambiata (Italian for changed note), has a number of different and related meanings in music. Generally it refers to a pattern in a homophonic or polyphonic (and usually contrapuntal) setting of a melody where a note is skipped from (typically by an interval of a third) in one direction (either going up or down in pitch) followed by the note skipped to, and then by motion in the opposite direction, and where either the note skipped from is distinguished as a dissonance or the note skipped to is distinguished as a non-harmonic or non-chordal tone.  With regards to music pedagogical activities and species counterpoint, it refers to a more specific set of patterns.
The cambiata is also called changing note in English, though the literal meaning of the Italian is changed note. It is not to be confused with changing tones, which resolve to the original note. The terminology used in other languages (G. Wechselnote, Fr. note de rechange) all of which relate to the concepts of ""change"" or ""exchange"".


== In species counterpoint ==
In species counterpoint, the dissonant cambiata can be called an idiom in that it is considered an acceptable pattern even though it breaks a rule, in this case, that of skipping from a dissonance.  The dissonance in the dissonant cambiata is approached by descending step and occurs on a weak half or quarter of the beat; the skip from the dissonance must be a descending third to a consonance; and this consonance must be followed by some number of ascending steps.  This means there are only three possible essential dissonant cambiatas in third species: Two above the cantus firmus, with vertical intervals 8-7-5-6 (Ex.1) and 6-b5-3-4 (Ex.2); and one below the C.F., with 3-4-6-5 (Ex.3).

The consonant cambiata is not considered an idiom like the dissonant version as it does not break any rules of species counterpoint by itself. There are two consonant cambiatas in third species: One above the C.F., with 6-5-3-4; and one below, with 5-6-8-7.  Whereas, when dealing with species counterpoint, the dissonant cambiata is frequently called, simply, cambiata, the consonant cambiata is rarely called cambiata at all.
The inverted cambiata is a cambiata where the melodic movement of the contrapunctus is inverted; where the dissonant cambiata has a skip down a third, the inverted cambiata has a skip up a third, etc.  There are both dissonant and consonant inverted cambiatas.  There are three dissonant inverted cambiatas in third species: One above the C.F., with 3-4-6-5; and two below, with 8-7-5-6 and 6-b5-3-4.  There are two consonant inverted cambiatas in third species: One above the C.F., with 5-6-8-7; and one below, with 6-5-3-4.
In fifth species, cambiatas need not be quarter-note lines added to whole-note cantus firmi as in these examples, which is only a requirement of the third species, but could take many different rhythmic forms.  Rhythmically, it is only essential that the dissonance that is skipped from be in a weak position, when not considering any other rules which may apply. This means further that the cambiatas need not have the same pattern of vertical intervals that the cambiatas in third species have. Example 4 shows a dissonant cambiata in fifth species.


== Outside species counterpoint ==
Outside species counterpoint, what is considered a cambiata varies. What is common to all is that a note is skipped from in one direction and this is followed by motion in the opposite direction, and either the note skipped from is distinguished as a dissonance or the note skipped to is distinguished as a non-chordal tone.  This means that three aspects of cambiata in species counterpoint—that the note which is skipped from must be preceded by a step, that the skip be a third, and that the note which is skipped to must be followed by a step in the opposite direction of the skip—are not necessarily all true for all patterns which are considered cambiatas. For example, a pattern in two-voice counterpoint, similar to the dissonant or dissonant inverted cambiata in species counterpoint, but which only does not follow the dissonance which is skipped to with a step in the opposite direction, but rather with a skip in the opposite direction, is still called a cambiata.  This is shown in Example 5, which is from Guerrero's Ex. 16-15.
Example 6 shows a cambiata at * as a nonharmonic tone which is skipped to, rather than as a dissonance which is skipped from.  It is approached by a skip in one direction and left by step in the opposite direction.  The same pattern occurs at (*), and this too may be considered a cambiata, but might not if the chord is considered a major seventh rather than a triad, and so the note would not be nonharmonic.

What is cambiata?
Cambiata"
Reductive_stress,Start,1,"Reductive stress (RS) is defined as an abnormal accumulation of reducing equivalents despite being in the presence of intact oxidation and reduction systems. A redox reaction involves the transfer of electrons from reducing agents (reductants) to oxidizing agents (oxidants) and redox couples are accountable for the majority of the cellular electron flow. RS is a state where there are more reducing equivalents compared to reductive oxygen species (ROS) in the form of known biological redox couples such as GSH/GSSG, NADP+/NADPH, and NAD+/NADH. Reductive stress is the counterpart to oxidative stress, where electron acceptors are expected to be mostly reduced. Reductive stress is likely derived from intrinsic signals that allow for the cellular defense against pro-oxidative conditions. There is a feedback regulation balance between reductive and oxidative stress where chronic RS induce oxidative species (OS), resulting in an increase in production of RS, again.


== Implications of reductive stress ==
There are several implications of an excess of reducing equivalents: regulation of cellular signaling pathways by decreasing cell growth responses, modification of transcriptional activity, perturbs disulfide bond formation within proteins, increase of mitochondrial malfunction, decrease in cellular metabolism, and cytotoxicity. The over expression of antioxidant enzymatic systems promote the excess production of reducing equivalents resulting in the depletion of ROS and prompting RS in cells. Nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (Nrf2) is an important transcription factor that regulates a multitude of genes that code for antioxidant response and after uncontrolled amplification of this signaling pathway RS increases. Although different organelles may each have a different redox status, through probing for factors such as glutathione and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), it was determined that reductive stress is present in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of senescent cells. Reductive stress is significant in the aging process of a cell and when ER oxidation status is elevated, cellular aging is slowed. In particular, when reductive stress is increased, it may result in many downstream effects such as increased apoptosis, decreased cell survival, and mitochondrial dysfunction—all of which need to be properly regulated to ensure that the needs of the cell are met. Data shows, in an isolated mitochondria, when there is a high ratio of NADH/NAD+, an example of RS, ROS increases significantly in the mitochondrial matrix which results in H2O2 spillover from the mitochondria. Reductive stress has even been suggested to lead to higher probability of cardiomyopathy in humans. This has also been mysteriously linked to the abundant presence of heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27), suggesting that high levels of Hsp27 induce can induce cardiomyopathy.  Reductive stress is present in many diseases with abnormalities such as the increase of reducing equivalents, resulting in issues such as hypoxia-induced oxidative stress. A more reductive redox environment promotes cancer metastasis and cancer cells use reductive stress to promote growth and resist anti-cancer agents, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

Glidden_Tour,Start,1,"The Glidden Tours, also known as the National Reliability Runs, were promotional events held during the automotive Brass Era by the American Automobile Association (AAA) and organized by the group's chairman, Augustus Post.  The AAA, a proponent of safer roads, acceptance of the automobile, and automotive-friendly legislation, started the tour to promote public acceptance and bring awareness of their goals.
The original Glidden Tours were held from 1904 to 1913. They were named after Charles J. Glidden, a financier and automobile enthusiast, who presented the AAA with a trophy first awarded to the winner of the 1905 tour.
In 1906, the Glidden Tours were the first motor race to use a checkered flag to indicate the end of the race: Sidney Walden divided the courses into sections; the time check at the end of each section was performed by race officials called ""checkers."" These checkers used checkered flags to identify themselves.
The first two days of the 1907 edition of the Glidden Auto Tour were marred by a number of accidents that resulted in the death of one man, Thomas J. Clark, lifelong friend and partner of John K. Stewart, and four other persons severely injured. While trying to make a sharp angle in the road preparatory to crossing a bridge, about two miles east of Bryan, Ohio, Mr. Clark lost control of his Packard that jumped over an embankment. The car turned over and he was crushed between the steering wheel, suffering several ribs broken and serious internal injuries, from which he succumbed four days later at Bryan hospital. It is believed that Mr. Clark was demonstrating the Stewart speedometer on the 1907 Glidden Auto Tour.
At the turn of the century automobile travel was difficult as the road systems around the world were generally not well suited for the horseless carriage.
To bring more awareness and sponsorship to the event, the AAA announced that the tour would be a ""reliability and endurance"" tour, a type of road rally. This attracted automobile manufacturers who competed to test their vehicles and use the events for advertising.
The tours were gruelling events: cars broke down, were damaged by accidents, and encountered nearly impassable roads. Drivers and teams did repairs on the run and helped out other drivers having difficulties.
The tours went several hundred miles in the US and occasionally into Canada with time limits between check points and a point scoring system to determine a winner of each event. The time limits caused some problems with the inhabitants of where the tour traveled through as autos scared horses, caused personal and property damage and sometimes appeared to not care.


== Revival ==

The Glidden Tours were revived in 1946 by the Veteran Motor Car Club of America (VMCCA) and have continued since with antique cars traveling premarked routes and stopping in local towns to show off their vehicles, many people dressed in period costume. Original founder Augustus Post participated in every Glidden Tour until his death in 1952. In 1954, Dr. Jay Rice Moody was given the Col. Augustus Post Memorial Award by the AAA in recognition for his role in reestablishing the Glidden Auto Tours, and maintaining the spirit of the original tours as founded by Post.
The silver Glidden trophy is still presented to the winner of the event.

Mesh_(band),Start,1,"Mesh are a British electronic alternative band from Bristol, England. They have achieved chart success and recognition in Europe.


== Biography ==
Mesh formed in 1991 after lead singer Mark Hockings and Richard Silverthorn (keyboards) met each other at a concert where Richard Silverthorn's band was playing. Soon afterwards, Neil Taylor, Silverthorn's former bandmate, joined the band on keyboards. The creative writing was split between Richard Silverthorn, who composes the music, and Mark Hockings, who writes the lyrics.
Mesh were signed by the Swedish label Memento Materia and an EP, Fragile, was released in 1994. This was followed by a full album, In This Place Forever, in 1996, and 1997 the band released an extended version of Fragile. A compilation album, Fragmente, was released in 1998, and a new studio album, The Point At Which It Falls Apart in 1999. In 2000 they worked with the German dance producer Mark Oh, releasing the track ""Waves"", which reached position 83 in the German charts.
In 2002, Mesh were picked up by Sony Records, and released a new album Who Watches Over Me. The band grew in popularity in continental Europe, and most notably in Germany, where their singles and albums repeatedly attained chart positions. In 2006 a new album, 'We Collide', was released, produced by former Depeche Mode producer, Gareth Jones.
On 13 September 2006 Taylor announced he was leaving the band after 15 years to pursue other interests. Hockings and Silverthorn decided to continue as a duo, using an augmented line-up for live shows. Initially, Geoff Pinckney replaced Taylor at live shows.
The new line-up signed to Dependent Records as their European record label. Metropolis Records represents them in the US and South America. A Perfect Solution was released in 2009. It was produced by the German dark electro producer Olaf Wollschläger. Silverthorn stated: ""Olaf has a natural talent of tidying up our productions and spending a ridiculous amount of time perfecting them without changing the overall feel and mood"". Olaf has continued to work with Mesh on subsequent releases. In 2011 the band followed up A Perfect Solution with a remix of the album, entitled An Alternative Solution. In April 2011, the group toured the United States for the first time, playing on the ""Legends of Synthpop"" tour with Iris and De/Vision.
On 26 August 2011 the band announced via Twitter that Geoff Pinckney ""will no longer be playing live with Mesh"", as he wished to focus on his other musical project, Tenek. He was replaced by Richard Broadhead. Live drummer Sean Suleman also joined the line up around this time.
In 2013 the band released Automation Baby, which became the band's most successful album up to that point, entering the German charts at number 33, and topping the European Alternative Charts.
Following this success, the band felt under pressure to deliver with the followup album. When Looking Skyward was released in 2016, it achieved a number 12 position in the German charts, their highest to date.
In 2015 the band played with a classical orchestra at the 'Gothic meets Klassik' festival, hosted at the 'Gewandhaus zu Leipzig' in Leipzig. The show was recorded and initially scheduled for release in 2016. It was later decided to expand the live recording with some additional studio recorded tracks. These were recorded at Tonscheune Oleak, and the release was pushed back to late 2017.
Mesh have acquired a fan base in Germany and Scandinavia, and have also gained notice in North and South American countries. However, success and recognition in their home country of the UK has eluded them. Richard Silverthorn has discussed this in several interviews, stating that while he would love some recognition in the UK, the band has been lucky to find a market for what they do elsewhere and that is now what is important to them.
In April 2023 Vaughn George joined the live line-up on keyboards and backing vocals.

Resolution_enhancement_technologies,Start,1,"Resolution enhancement technologies are methods used to modify the photomasks in the lithographic processes used to make integrated circuits (ICs or ""chips"") to compensate for limitations in the optical resolution of the projection systems. These processes allow the creation of features well beyond the limit that would normally apply due to the Rayleigh criterion. Modern technologies allow the creation of features on the order of 5 nanometers (nm), far below the normal resolution possible using deep ultraviolet (DUV) light.


== Background ==
Integrated circuits are created in a multi-step process known as photolithography. This process starts with the design of the IC circuitry as a series of layers than will be patterned onto the surface of a sheet of silicon or other semiconductor material known as a wafer.
Each layer of the ultimate design is patterned onto a photomask, which in modern systems is made of fine lines of chromium deposited on highly purified quartz glass. Chromium is used because it is highly opaque to UV light, and quartz because it has limited thermal expansion under the intense heat of the light sources as well as being highly transparent to ultraviolet light. The mask is positioned over the wafer and then exposed to an intense UV light source. With a proper optical imaging system between the mask and the wafer (or no imaging system if the mask is sufficiently closely positioned to the wafer such as in early lithography machines), the mask pattern is imaged on a thin layer of photoresist on the surface of the wafer and a light (UV or EUV)-exposed part of the photoresist experiences chemical reactions causing the photographic pattern to be physically created on the wafer.
When light shines on a pattern like that on a mask, diffraction effects occur. This causes the sharply focused light from the UV lamp to spread out on the far side of the mask and becoming increasingly unfocussed over distance. In early systems in the 1970s, avoiding these effects required the mask to be placed in direct contact with the wafer in order to reduce the distance from the mask to the surface. When the mask was lifted it would often pull off the resist coating and ruin that wafer. Producing a diffraction-free image was ultimately solved through the projection aligner systems, which dominated chip making through the 1970s and early 1980s.
The relentless drive of Moore's law ultimately reached the limit of what the projection aligners could handle. Efforts were made to extend their lifetimes by moving to ever-higher UV wavelengths, first to DUV and then to EUV, but the small amounts of light given off at these wavelengths made the machines impractical, requiring enormous lamps and long exposure times. This was solved through the introduction of the steppers, which used a mask at much larger sizes and used lenses to reduce the image. These systems continued to improve in a fashion similar to the aligners, but by the late 1990s were also facing the same issues.
At the time, there was considerable debate about how to continue the move to smaller features. Systems using excimer lasers in the soft-X-ray region were one solution, but these were incredibly expensive and difficult to work with. It was at this time that resolution enhancement began to be used.


== Basic concept ==
The basic concept underlying the various resolution enhancement systems is the creative use of diffraction in certain locations to offset the diffraction in others. For instance, when light diffracts around a line on the mask it will produce a series of bright and dark lines, or ""bands"". that will spread out the desired sharp pattern. To offset this, a second pattern is deposited whose diffraction pattern overlaps with the desired features, and whose bands are positioned to overlap the original pattern's to produce the opposite effect - dark on light or vice versa. Multiple features of this sort are added, and the combined pattern produces the original feature. Typically, on the mask these additional features look like additional lines lying parallel to the desired feature.
Adding these enhancement features has been an area of continual improvement since the early 2000s. In addition to using additional patterning, modern systems add phase-shifting materials, multiple-patterning and other techniques. Together, they have allowed feature size to continue to shrink to orders of magnitude below the diffraction limit of the optics.


== Using resolution enhancement ==
Traditionally, after an IC design has been converted into a physical layout, the timing verified, and the polygons certified to be DRC-clean, the IC was ready for fabrication. The data files representing the various layers were shipped to a mask shop, which used mask-writing equipment to convert each data layer into a corresponding mask, and the masks were shipped to the fab where they were used to repeatedly manufacture the designs in silicon. In the past, the creation of the IC layout was the end of the involvement of electronic design automation.
However, as Moore's law has driven features to ever-smaller dimensions, new physical effects that could be effectively ignored in the past are now affecting the features that are formed on the silicon wafer.  So even though the final layout may represent what is desired in silicon, the layout can still undergo dramatic alteration through several EDA tools before the masks are fabricated and shipped. These alterations are required not to make any change in the device as designed, but to simply allow the manufacturing equipment, often purchased and optimized for making ICs one or two generations behind, to deliver the new devices. These alterations can be classed as being of two types.
The first type is distortion corrections, namely pre-compensating for distortions inherent in the manufacturing process, be it from a processing step, such as: photolithography, etching, planarization, and deposition. These distortions are measured and a suitable model fitted, compensation is carried out usually using a rule or model based algorithm. When applied to printing distortions during photolithography, this distortion compensation is known as Optical Proximity Correction (OPC).
The second type of Reticle Enhancement involves actually improving the manufacturability or resolution of the process. Examples of this include:

For each of these manufacturability improvement techniques there are certain layouts that either cannot be improved or cause issues in printing. These are classed as non-compliant layouts. These are avoided either at the design stage - using, for instance, Radically Restrictive Design Rules and/or creating addition DRC checks if appropriate. Both the lithographic compensations and manufacturability improvements are usually grouped under the heading resolution enhancement techniques (RET). Such techniques have been used since the 180nm node and have become more aggressively used as minimum feature size as dropped significantly below that of the imaging wavelength, currently limited to 13.5 nm.
This is closely related to, and a part of, the more general category of design for manufacturability (IC) or DFM.
After RET, the next step in an EDA flow is usually mask data preparation.

Communication_quotient,Start,1,"Communication quotient (CQ; alternately called communication intelligence or CI) is the theory that communication is a behavior-based skill that can be measured and trained. CQ measures the ability of people to communicate effectively with one another. In 1999 Mario de Vries was the first to present a theory on CQ measurement. The first scholarly article referring to CQ was ""CQ: the Communication Quotient for IS professionals"" by Robert Service.


== History ==
The development of CQ began with challenges to the idea that IQ fully explained cognitive ability. In 1983 Howard Gardner published Frames of Mind: The Theory of Multiple Intelligences. Gardner claimed that IQ failed to fully explain cognitive ability. CQ is one of Gardner's ""intelligences"". Daniel Goleman's emotional intelligence and social intelligence are others. As explained by de Vries: one measure of intelligence is to be able to explain an insight, whether it is analytical or emotional. Hence, CQ is required to activate IQ and EQ.


== Definitions ==
The Times of India in 2005 , in ""A Shift from IQ"", referred to CQ as an ability multi-national corporations were seeking among Indian graduates. In 2005 Craig Harrison in Improving Your Communication Quotient described CQ skills specifically in terms of workplace communication. In 2007 Clare Munn defined CQ as ""Expressive & Receptive Intelligence"" the communication bridge between IQ and EQ. In 2011 Alistair Gordon and Steve Kimmens in The CQ Manifesto defined CQ as ""saying the right thing in the right way to the right people at the right time in a such a way that the message is received and understood as it was intended"".
Robert Service presented CQ as a measurable and improvable type of intelligence, specifically for IT and IS professionals. Service argued that the improvement of communication skills allows individuals promotion opportunities. The article presents two models to explain communication:

a model of two-way communications
CQ measurement and improvement matrix.
In 2020 de Vries finished research into the distinctive factors of communication at HAN University of Applied Sciences in Arnhem. He concluded that all communication models are mere frameworks than models, because they lack measurement. Furthermore these frameworks only visualizations of information flows. De Vries defined more than forty communication competences in seven different layers. The result is a proven system for measuring CQ. De Vries claimed that communication competences are different from communications skills, such as presentation skills. Competences can be taught in a learning program, skills need to be trained. He defines CQ as ""the competence and creativity to communicate content in the context of the consumer to maximize the capacity of that information"".

ATI_HPSS,Start,1,"The ATI Soundblaster HPSS (High-Power Speaker Station) is an electronic outdoor warning siren manufactured by Acoustic Technology, Inc (ATI) that is used to alert citizens of air raids, natural disasters and so on. The recent HPSS systems use high-powered electronic speakers, which can be independently arranged to provide directional or omnidirectional coverage, depending on installation. The HPSS16 have 4 speakers and the  HPSS32 have 8 speakers. They can also be used as public announcement (PA) systems, and can play a number of programmed tones. Options include solar-powered operation pre-recorded voice messages. ATI also sold rotational units of the HPSS16, and HPSS32, called the ""HPSS16R"" and ""HPSS32R"", that are now discontinued.

The_Cardinals,Start,1,"The Cardinals were an American R&B group of the 1950s. Sharing a legacy with the Orioles, The Cardinals are remembered as one of the best R&B ballad acts to come out of Baltimore.


== Origins ==
The Cardinals’ career began in 1946 (one year before The Orioles) when Leon Hardy and Meredith Brothers convinced Donald Johnson to join them in harmony on the corner of Gay Street and Forest. Johnson drafted his friend Ernie Warren to round out a quartet and the new group on the block became The Mellotones. They did the usual round of Baltimore bars and nightclubs for experience, singing the songs of black and white pop groups such as The Fortunes, The Ink Spots, and The Ames Brothers. They picked up a fifth member, Jack Aydelotte, when he and they were separately scheduled to perform on The Major Baumgartner Show, a local TV talent show. They never got on the air as the show ran overtime, but thanks to the booking they now had five members including an accompanist (Jack also played guitar).


== Recording contract ==
The years passed and a record contract came their way with the help of Super Music Record Shop store owner Sam Azrael. With group member Donald Johnson working in the store for years, Azrael had had plenty of exposure to the crooners. When Herb Abramson, co-founder of Atlantic Records, passed through Baltimore in 1951 on a talent search, Azrael gave the act an audition, and it's reported the group left the shop that very night as the newest artists on Atlantic.
In March 1950 the group came to New York, cutting four sides for their first release and simultaneously becoming The Cardinals. Five months later Shouldn’t I Know peaked at #7 on the Billboard Best Seller R&B chart. It is a pretty ballad that was written by Meredith Brothers, but in a maneuver that was typical of the music business at the time, store owner Azrael wound up listed as a co-writer.
Their next session of songs, recorded on October 6, 1950, included their second single I’ll Always Love You, another ballad that featuring Warren's strong lead ably supported by the warbling Cardinals. They also recorded an R&B version of Wheel of Fortune later to be released as their 3rd single in March 1952. Between February and March 1952, various versions of the song were pop hits for Kay Starr (#1), Bobby Wayne (#6), The Bell Sisters (#10) and Sunny Gale (#13). The Cardinals (#6), along with Dinah Washington (#3), scored R&B hits.


== Member changes ==
Right after the release of Wheel of Fortune, Warren was drafted and replaced by Leander Tarver. The new member led the group through their next single, “The Bump,” released the first week of August 1952.
Toward the end of 1952 Tarver left and James Brown (not James Brown) joined. Warren returned on leave from the military just in time to record You Are My Only Love and three other tunes on January 13, 1953. With James Brown still in the lineup, this session benefited from six very good voices.


== Next releases ==
The group had not had a single in five months and it was beginning to appear that Atlantic was either losing interest or waiting for Warren to return full-time from the army. This is at least one possible explanation for the release of only two singles in two years. They were You Are My Only Love, released the fourth week of May 1953, and Under a Blanket of Blue (a song recorded nearly 2+1⁄2 years earlier) released the third week of April 1954. Warren rejoined the group full-time in March 1954, but the septet wasn't brought in to record until January 18, 1955, more than two years after their last session. The primary yield of this four-song date was the Chuck Willis-penned The Door Is Still Open to My Heart, which was issued as a single in the fourth week of February 1955.
A stunning vocal interpretation of a deceptively simple melody gave the Cardinals their biggest hit as The Door Is Still Open (To My Heart) reached top 10 R&B Best Seller and #7 Jukebox for a total of 13 weeks. Billboard R&B charts later listed it as the 43rd best seller of 1955.
The Cardinals' records at this time were some of their best, though not their most popular. In July 1955 Atlantic released the group's 8th single, Come Back My Love, a song issued five months earlier by Rama Records artists The Wrens. Neither charted, though both would later become doo wop cult classics. December arrived with Here Goes My Heart to You, an ultra-smooth ballad that somehow escaped notice. The same happened to their all-time best ballad effort Offshore and The End of the Story, their next-to-last Atlantic single.
The group's last Atlantic single was another ballad titled One Love,  worth mentioning because of the writing team that created it, Lou Stallman and Joe Shapiro (the same pair who wrote Perry Como’s hit “Round and Round”). It was released in January 1957, just around the time the group called it quits. Warren formed a new group in late 1957 with tenors Sonny Hatchett and Jimmy Ricks (not The Ravens’ bass lead), baritone Richard Williams, and Jim Boone on bass. They recorded several sides, including the early 1950s-sounding ballad Have I Been Gone Too Long. These almost a cappella recordings stayed in the vaults for 17 years until Bim Bam Boom Records released an EP of the songs.


== Group reformed ==
In 1958, Warren re-formed the original Cardinals with Johnson, Brothers, and Johnny Douglas, as well as Jim Boone. After a few months, the group added an all-white backup band, a strange combination for 1958.  This backup band featured Bob Passon on bass and Jerry Passon's vocals.
The Cardinals performed into the early 1960s and then drifted apart for the last time. Among rhythm and blues record enthusiasts the group is as popular today as they were in the mid-1950s. Their nine Atlantic recording sessions produced 36 sides of which only 24 have ever been released.

Camera_auto-calibration,Start,1,"Camera auto-calibration is the process of determining internal camera parameters directly from multiple uncalibrated images of unstructured scenes. In contrast to classic camera calibration, auto-calibration does not require any special calibration objects in the scene.  In the visual effects industry, camera auto-calibration is often part of the ""Match Moving"" process where a synthetic camera trajectory and intrinsic projection model are solved to reproject synthetic content into video.
Camera auto-calibration is a form of sensor ego-structure discovery; the subjective effects of the sensor are separated from the objective effects of the environment leading to a reconstruction of the perceived world without the bias applied by the measurement device.  This is achieved via the fundamental assumption that images are projected from a Euclidean space through a linear, 5 degree of freedom (in the simplest case), pinhole camera model with non-linear optical distortion.  The linear pinhole parameters are the focal length, the aspect ratio, the skew, and the 2D principal point.  With only a set of uncalibrated (or calibrated) images, a scene may be reconstructed up to a six degree of freedom euclidean transform and an isotropic scaling.
A mathematical theory for general multi-view camera self-calibration was originally demonstrated in 1992 by Olivier Faugeras, QT Luong, and Stephen J. Maybank.  In 3D scenes and general motions, each pair of views provides two constraints on the 5 degree-of-freedom calibration.  Therefore, three views are the minimum needed for full calibration with fixed intrinsic parameters between views. Quality modern imaging sensors and optics may also provide further prior constraints on the calibration such as zero skew (orthogonal pixel grid) and unity aspect ratio (square pixels).  Integrating these priors will reduce the minimal number of images needed to two.  It is possible to auto-calibrate a sensor from a single image given supporting information in a structured scene.  For example, calibration may be obtained if multiple sets of parallel lines or objects with a known shape (e.g. circular) are identified.

MHV_connector,Start,1,"The MHV (miniature high voltage) connector is a type of RF connector used for terminating coaxial cable.


== Description ==
The connector looks almost identical to a typical BNC connector, but is designed to not mate with BNC jacks. It features two bayonet lugs on the female connector; mating is fully achieved with a quarter turn of the coupling nut. The dimensions of the connector are specified in the MIL-STD-348B. MHV connectors can be recognized by the slightly protruding insulation on the male plug and the slightly different insulation length in the female jack.


== Use ==
The MHV connector is typically rated for 1500 VRMS continuous and 5000 V peak, and 3 amperes. With an operating frequency limited to about 300 MHz their usage is restricted to low frequency applications. It was commonly used in laboratory settings for voltages beyond the rating of BNC connectors. Other applications include:

Geiger counters
Scintillation probes
Transmission lines
High-voltage power supplies
Nuclear control instrumentation
X-ray devices


== Safety hazards ==

MHV connectors are a safety hazard because the central pin is close enough to the end to allow accidental contact with it when the connector is not plugged in, and because the ground connection is broken before the power connection when demating.
An additional problem is that MHV connectors are easily mistaken for BNC connectors by users who are unaware of the difference, and MHV and BNC plugs and jacks can be made to mate by brute force. This causes safety hazards, since a user can mate a low voltage cable to a high voltage jack. 
SHV connectors are designed to prevent these hazards, and cannot be mated to BNC connectors.

Tertium_comparationis,Start,1,"Tertium comparationis (Latin for ""the third [part] of the comparison"") is the quality that two things which are being compared have in common. It is the point of comparison which prompted the author of the comparison in question to liken someone or something to someone or something else in the first place.
If a comparison visualizes an action, state, quality, object, or a person by means of a parallel which is drawn to a different entity, the two things which are being compared do not necessarily have to be identical. However, they must possess at least one quality in common. This common quality has traditionally been referred to as tertium comparationis.
The most common devices used to achieve this are metaphors and similes, especially, but by no means exclusively, in poetic language.  In many cases one aspect of the comparison is implied rather than made explicit. The New Testament scholar, Adolf Jülicher, applied the concept of tertium comparationis to the parables of Jesus. According to Jülicher, a parable or similitude (extended simile or metaphor) has three parts: a picture part (Bildhälfte), a reality part (Sachhälfte), and the point of comparison (tertium comparationis) between the picture part and the reality part. ""The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field, which someone found and hid; then in his joy he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field"" (Matthew 13:44). In this parable, the picture part is the hidden treasure, the reality part is God's kingdom, and the tertium comparationis is the inestimable value of the kingdom.


== Examples ==
Necessity is the mother of invention. (English proverb)
Objects of comparison: relationship between mother and child, relationship between necessity and invention
Tertium comparationis: source, where something derives from
Woman is the nigger of the world. (John Lennon)
Objects of comparison: treatment of Black people in US culture, treatment of women in global culture
Tertium comparationis: inhumane treatment, subjugation, discrimination
Goodbye, England's rose. (Elton John on the death of Princess Diana)
Objects of comparison: Diana; roses
Tertium comparationis: beauty
If they [our two souls] be two, they are two so
As stiff twin compasses are two;
Thy soul, the fixed foot, makes no show
To move, but doth, if th'other do.
(John Donne: ""A Valediction: Forbidding Mourning"") (Read the whole poem.)
Objects of comparison: two souls; twin compasses

The_Angelic_Symphony,Start,1,"The Angelic Symphony is a set of four sculptures by Leonard Woods in the chancel of St. Andrew's-Wesley United Church in Vancouver.
The sculptures were commissioned in 1947 by Elisabeth Rogers, a founder of the Vancouver Art Gallery and Vancouver Symphony Orchestra. Woods worked closely with the minister of St. Andrew's-Wesley United Church, the Reverend Oswald W. S. McCall. Installation took place in July 1948. The sculptures depict four angels of the Bible, each representing a different type of musician: a cymbalist, a trumpeter, a flautist, and a cellist. Woods' inspiration was drawn from Psalm 150, where God is praised with musical instruments, and the intention was to visually echo the church organ. The angels are realistic, semi-clad, and androgynous. They were modelled from the sculptor's friends. The modernity of the angels' instruments, in place of conventional harps, was reported by newspapers across the country. The 300 pound sculptures were made at Langley Prairie of plaster reinforced with iron, based on reverse molds derived from clay imported from California.   They were carved in bas-relief. 
The original finish of the sculptures over the ivory plaster was semi-transparent shellac with a hint of amber, against a blue background. It was thought by some of the congregation that the colours were too prominent, so they were painted grey in 1954. The Anglican Diocese of New Westminster reported in 2004 that the sculptures would be restored to their original colours. The project was overseen by Barry Gilson and the restoration work undertaken by Rose Quintana, who worked with Haida artist Bill Reid on the monumental sculpture the Jade Canoe. After the restoration, Woods felt that the colours now harmonized with the more recent stained glass windows.

Output-based_aid,Start,1,"Output-based aid (OBA) refers to development aid strategies that link the delivery of public services in developing countries to targeted performance-related subsidies. OBA subsidies are offered in transport construction, education, water and sanitation systems, and healthcare among other sectors where positive externalities exceed cost recovery exclusively from private markets.


== Overview ==
OBA targets individuals who lack the financial means to pay for basic services. It is specifically targeted for individuals in developing countries. The service provider will receive subsidies to replace costs associated with providing the service to people, such as user fees. Individual agents will verify that the service is being delivered and based on the performance of the service-provider, a subsidy will be granted. That is how it is ""performance-based"".
OBA generally works through a private firm, or another third party, acting as the service provider. The service provider is responsible for the initial financing of the project and, only after results have been verified, will the firm receive subsidies from a donor. In such schemes, it is the provider who bears the risk of loss, rather than the aid donor, and output-based schemes allow for the tracking of results because of the way they function. Integration of the private sector into aid schemes is common with OBA, since they often provide the initial financing. The World Bank sees OBA as a way to improve aid effectiveness. This differs from traditional aid schemes that will usually focus on the inputs to service providers rather than the outputs. The donor is usually the World Bank, a government or an international organization or philanthropist that is part of the OBA scheme. Subsidies from a donor will generally serve to complement or reduce user fees. The subsidy is paid only after the particular service has been delivered to a community. The subsidies are targeted to poorer individuals, since OBA initiatives are carried out in regions with significant amounts of poverty.
In healthcare, vouchers are granted to patients who require medical attention and cannot afford or access it. These vouchers can be taken to hospitals or clinics, whether private or public, and they will be provided with the medical attention they require. The clinic or healthcare professional that provided the medical service will be subsidized for the delivery of the service by a donor.


== Advantages ==
According to the GPOBA, OBA improves upon other forms of aid in a number of ways. The first is by creating transparency since the provider and receiver of any subsidy will be known to each other and the public. Performance risk is shifted to the providers in OBA schemes since they are accountable for what they deliver. OBA schemes are said to provide incentives for innovation in projects as well as a means for mobilizing expertise and finance from the private sector. Finally, OBA provides internal tracking of results.
Malcolm Potts of the University of California, Berkeley believes OBA schemes to be more effective than traditional aid projects because they invest in extant infrastructure. OBA schemes can provide poor consumers with the leverage to determine the quality of the service they are provided with. For example, in a health-care project, individuals receiving OBA will gain choice in where they want to go for their health care needs, essentially a choice between options in the public and private sector. With OBA, existing service providers are granted subsidies based on the number of people who use their services. In this way an individual can choose between multiple service providers, whether public, private or non-governmental, and only after the service has been provided do they receive the subsidy.
Compared to other aid schemes where projects were pre-funded by a donor, OBA uses explicit funding; if service providers fail to deliver, they and their investors, rather than taxpayers, who bear the brunt of financial loss.


== Problem areas ==
For many common criticisms of development aid, see criticism of aid.
OBA schemes have been criticized for their high administrative costs which exist for a number of reasons. The printing and distribution of vouchers can be costly.  Also, there is significant cost in effectively monitoring outcomes of OBA schemes, and maintaining a process of transparency in OBA. Voucher theft or counterfeiting could be a serious issue for OBA projects. The sale on vouchers on the black market could easily disrupt the knowledge of where vouchers are distributed.
Performance-based conditionality has come under criticism for producing intermediate indicators which often distort the achievements of particular projects. These indicators, which only convey the success of certain actors and which are susceptible to manipulation, do not provide accurate indication of long-term changes of benefit to a region. Progress should be measured in more long-term objectives which encompass many sectors that contribute to the well-being of a population. For example, reducing child mortality requires many areas—health care, family planning and clean water—to be targeted, and even though intermediate indicators of an OBA scheme in one sector may appear positive, this does not necessarily identify progress in reducing child mortality.
The Private Sector Development Strategy which OBA is included in has come under heavy criticism for many of the same reasons the World Bank has been criticized for its work in the past as well as many new criticisms of the strategy itself. In response, it has been criticized for ignoring the many dimensions of poverty and not defining well how the ""poor"" would benefit from market interventions. The idea that private sector development and OBA will ""shift risk"" to private-sector service providers has been criticized since many private groups are risk averse when it comes to making a profit and thus would be hesitant in taking on projects lacking a guaranteed payoff.
Professor Robert Wade, of the London School of Economics, said in an article that the PSD strategy is:

""A continuation of previous Bank policies to reduce the state to a coordination and regulation role, leaving private companies to organise production and service delivery.""
Much aid is tied to conditionality and, even though OBA rewards performance, it will mainly reward performance in the private sector. The PSD strategy looks to the private sector to develop infrastructure that will benefit the poor. An issue that many multinational corporations will receive some of the funding for OBAs has not been dealt with very well by the World Bank. Not only does this allow them to further their economic control of infrastructure in poorer nations, they are also able to avoid many of the risks of OBA through various agreements and by passing on some of the costs to the state and the taxpayers. For example, the lease for a Guinea water infrastructure OBA project:

allowed the MNC to protect itself against cost increases by passing them on, with the government regulator unable to force the MNC to disclose enough information to judge the reasonableness of the requests.""

Privatizing basic services is a contentious issue because contracting out service provision to private firms may be detrimental to universal service provision. Private firms look to make a profit, and if this is their primary motive then universal access becomes less of a priority. Accountability to state services may deteriorate. Many critics have noted that in developed countries, the state is responsible for basic services that the World Bank wants private firms to provide in developing countries. UNICEF, in a study entitled ""Basic Services for All: Public Spending and the Social Dimensions of Poverty"", laid out moral, consensual, instrumental and historical grounds, arguing that state provision of basic services is mandatory regardless of circumstance.
Output-based approaches generally will rely on a well-established market, something that is not present in many developing countries. The regulatory and institutional mechanisms of the market are almost non-existent in many nations where OBA is used, and this does not allow domestic firms to compete on level ground with foreign firms. Sarah Anderson of the Institute for Policy Studies said that many grassroots and community organizations will not have the means to provide initial financing for service projects. They will be unable to sustain themselves until they get a subsidy for their performance. Rather, global firms that are already well established will more likely get OBA contracts, and in the process many local organization will no longer be part of the scheme.


== History ==
The first instance of voucher-based OBA was in South Korea and Taiwan in the 1960s. According to Malcolm Potts, these family-planning initiatives were very successful. There were few such instances where OBA was used for development purposes up until the new millennium. Voucher-based healthcare schemes were piloted in Latin America, Asia and Africa in the 1990s and early 2000s.
In 2002, the World Bank launched its Private Sector Development Strategy (PSD), of which OBA was a key component. The World Bank has been the most active participant in OBA and in 2003, along with the UK's Department for International Development (DFID), they launched the Global Partnership on Output-Based Aid (GPOBA), a ""Partnership of donors and international organizations working together to support OBA approaches to improving service delivery for the poor"".
The partnership has worked with various international partners to pursue output-based initiatives in fields of healthcare, water, energy, transport, telecommunications and education. As of June 2009, GPOBA has identified 128 OBA projects around the world, with a value of $3.3 billion.
German development bank KfW financed multi-district pilot projects in East Africa (Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda) and South Asia (Bangladesh and Cambodia) beginning in 2006.


== Examples ==
In healthcare, OBA is often implemented by contracting providers in either the public or private sector, sometimes both, and issuing vouchers to people considered at higher risk of disease or in greater need of the health services. Two of the earliest examples of competitive vouchers and fee-for-service contracts in healthcare were implemented in South Korea and Taiwan in the 1960s. In Nicaragua, the Instituto CentroAmericano de la Salud (Central American Health Institute) began voucher programs for reproductive and sexual health services in 1995. New programs for facility-based maternal deliveries in Kenya and Uganda began in 2006 and 2009 respectively.
In Mongolia projects to improve rural telecommunications have been undertaken. Existing communication operators bid for subsidy contracts to expand their networks and services to rural areas with poor access to telecommunications. The bidding operators were also aware of the risk associated with the subsidies, since they would only receive funding if certain outcomes had been met. These OBA schemes are meant to provide universal Internet access to the internet.
OBAs have had successes and failures based on the specific project. Many challenges have come to exist as a result of the diverse projects that have been carried out.

Professional_network_service,Start,1,"A professional network service (or, in an Internet context, simply a professional network) is a type of social network service that focuses on interactions and relationships for business opportunities and career growth, with less emphasis on activities in personal life.
A professional network service is used by working individuals, job-seekers, and businesses to establish and maintain professional contacts, to find work or hire employees, share professional achievements, sell or promote services, and stay up-to-date with industry news and trends. According to LinkedIn managing director Clifford Rosenberg in an interview with AAP in 2010, ""[t]his is a call to action for professionals to re-address their use of social networks and begin to reap as many rewards from networking professionally as they do personally."" Businesses mostly depend on resources and information outside the company and to get what they need, they need to reach out and professionally network with others, such as employees or clients as well as potential opportunities.
""Nardi, Whittaker, and Schwarz (2002) point out three main tasks that they believe networkers need to attend to keep a successful professional (intentional) network:
building a network, maintaining the network, and activating selected contacts. They stress that networkers need to continue to add new contacts to their network to access as many resources as possible and to maintain their network by staying in touch with their contacts. This is so that the contacts are easy to activate when the networker has work that needs to be done.""
By using a professional network service, businesses can keep all of their networks up-to-date, and in order, and helps figure out the best way to efficiently get in touch with each of them. A service that can do all that helps relieve some of the stress when trying to get things done.
Not all professional network services are online sites that help promote a business. Some services connect the user to other services that help promote the business other than online sites, such as phone/Internet companies that provide services and companies that specifically are designed to do all of the promoting, online and in person, for a business.


== History ==
In 1997, professional network services started up throughout the world and continue to grow. The first recognizable site to combine all features, such as creating profiles, adding friends, and searching for friends, was SixDegrees.com. According to Boyd and Ellison's article, ""Social Network Sites: Definition, History, and Scholarship"", from 1997 to 2001, several community tools began supporting various combinations of profiles and publicly articulated Friends. Boyd and Ellison go on to say that the next wave began with Ryze.com in 2001. It was introduced as a new way ""to help people leverage their business networks"".


== Inside the works ==
Quite a lot of work is put into a professional network service, such as the number of hours that go into them and the type of people they work for, as well as the business model of it all, such as the professional interaction and the multiple services they deal with.


=== Types of services ===
Some professional network services not only help promote the business but can also help in connecting to other people. Those services may include a specific phone and/or Internet company or a company that helps to connect with other businesses. According to the Society for New Communications Research (SNCR), there are at least nine online professional networks that are being used.


=== Professional interaction ===
Kaplan and Haenlein elaborate on five key considerations for companies when utilizing media. These include the importance of careful selection, the option to choose existing applications or develop custom ones, ensuring alignment with organizational activities, integrating a comprehensive media plan, and providing accessibility to all stakeholders.


==== Choose carefully ====
""Choosing the right medium for any given purpose depends on the target group to be reached and the message to be communicated. On one hand, each Social Media application usually attracts a certain group of people, and firms should be active wherever their customers are present. On the other hand, there may be situations whereby certain features are necessary to ensure effective communication, and these features are only offered by one specific application.""


==== Ensure activity alignment ====
""Sometimes you may decide to rely on various Social Media, or a set of different applications within the same group, to have the largest possible reach."" ""Using different contact channels can be a worthwhile and profitable strategy."" According to the Society for New Communications Research at Harvard University, ""the average professional belongs to 3–5 online networks for business use, and LinkedIn, Facebook, and Twitter are among the top used.""


==== Integrate a media plan ====
Social media and traditional media are ""both part of the same: your corporate image"" in the customers' eyes.


==== Allow access to all ====
""...once the firm has decided to utilize Social Media applications, it is worth checking that all employees may access them."" According to the SNCR, ""the convergence of Internet, mobile, and social media has taken significant shape as professionals rely on anywhere access to information, relationships, and networks.""


==== Online usage ====
""Half of the respondents report participating in 3 to 5 online professional networks. Another three in ten participate in 6 or more professional networks."" ""Popular social networks are now being used frequently as Professional Communities. More than nine in ten respondents indicated that they use LinkedIn and half reported using Facebook. Twitter and blogs were frequently listed as 'professional networks'.""


=== Business model ===
According to Michael Rappa's article, Business models on the Web"", ""a business model is the method of doing business by which a company can sustain itself – that is, generate revenue. The business model spells out how a company makes money by specifying where it is positioned in the value chain."" Rappa mentions that there are at least nine basic categories from which a business model can be separated. Those categories are a brokerage, advertising, infomediary, merchant, manufacturer, affiliate, community, subscription, and utility. ""...a firm may combine several different models as part of its overall Internet business strategy."" At first, Flickr started as a way to mainstream public relations.


== Social impact ==
When it comes to the social impact that professional network services have on today's society, it has proved to increase activity. According to the SNCR, ""[t]hree quarters of respondents rely on professional networks to support business decisions. Reliance has increased for essentially all respondents over the past three years. Younger (20–35) and older professionals (55+) are more active users of social tools than middle-aged professionals. More people are collaborating outside their company wall than within their organizational intranet.""


== Limitations ==
Since the internet and social media are a part of this ""world where consumers can speak so freely with each other and businesses have increasingly less control over the information available about them in cyberspace"", most firms and businesses are uncomfortable with all the freedom. According to Kaplan and Haenlein's article, ""Users of the world, unite! The challenges and opportunities of Social Media"", businesses are pushed aside and are only able to sit back and watch as their customers publicly post comments, which may or may not be well-written.

Random_two-sided_matching,Start,1,"A random two-sided matching is a process by which members of two groups are matched to each other in a random way. It is often used in sports in order to match teams in knock-out tournaments. In this context, it is often called a draw, as it is implemented by drawing balls at random from a bowl, each ball representing the name of a team.


== Examples ==


=== The UEFA Champions League draw ===
A random two-sided matching occurs in the UEFA Champions League Round of 16. After some games are done within 8 groups, the group winner and the group runner-up proceed to the champions league. The UEFA rules say that each winner should be paired with a runner-up. Without further constraints, this problem could easily be solved by finding a random permutation of the winners. But UEFA rules impose two additional constraints: two teams from the same group cannot be paired, and two teams from the same association cannot be paired. Thus, the goal is to choose a random matching in an incomplete bipartite graph.
The UEFA mechanism makes several draws from different bowls. At the beginning, there are:

Bowl 1, containing identical balls each of which represents one group runner-up;
Bowl 2, initially empty, to be filled and refilled later.
Bowls A to H, each of which represents a group winner and contains 7 balls with the winner's name on it.
The draw proceeds as follows:

A ball is drawn from bowl 1, and the runner-up's name is displayed;
A computer program shows all winners that can — according to the UEFA rules — be paired with the drawn runner-up. This takes into account not only current constraints, but also constraints for future runners-up.
From some of the bowls A to H, representing the potential winners, a single ball is taken and put in bowl 2;
The balls in bowl 2 are shuffled. One ball is drawn, and it represents the winner matched to the previously drawn runner-up.
Bowl 2 is emptied, and the process repeats for 8 rounds.
This procedure yields probabilities that are different than just choosing a matching at random; this creates a distortion in the matching probalities of different groups, which raises suspicion and conspiracy theories.


=== The FIFA draw ===
Another two-sided matching occurs in the FIFA World Cup. First, the runners-up are drawn in a random order. Then, each winner in turn is drawn, and it is matched to the first runner-up in the order, to which it can be matched according to the constraints.
This draw, too, produces distorted probabilities relative to the uniform-random matching.

Mortgage_interest_relief_at_source,Start,1,"Mortgage interest relief at source, or MIRAS, was a housing tax relief scheme in the United Kingdom from 1983 to 2000, which was introduced as a way of reducing the amount of tax relief granted to mortgage borrowers. 


== Function ==
As its name suggests, it allowed borrowers to make mortgage repayments that already included tax relief on interest, instead of the traditional method of reclaiming the tax from the Inland Revenue.


== History ==
Tax relief on interest had been available since income tax was introduced in the early 19th century but in 1969 the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, Roy Jenkins, ended this tax relief for all loans except for business purposes or for home buyers. This meant that borrowers could no longer claim tax relief on, for example, the interest on bank loans or overdrafts.
MIRAS built on the Option Mortgage Scheme of the 1970s, which had also offered reduced repayments as an alternative to reclaiming the tax relief. Its aim was to get over the problem that some borrowers on low incomes might not have sufficient income to claim back as much tax as higher tax payers. So according to a 1975 booklet describing the scheme at the time, it aimed to provide “benefits roughly equal to those that are available to people with higher incomes.”
Like the Option Mortgage Scheme, MIRAS also aimed to deal with the problem of inequality between borrowers. In the mid-1970s the top rate of income tax was 83% on an income above £20,000 a year. Unlimited mortgage interest relief set against these high levels of tax meant that high-income borrowers could save large amounts of tax. At the same time, tax income for the government was significantly reduced by this tax relief. Thus, MIRAS was brought in as a way to reduce this loss of tax, as well as mitigating the inequality between home-owners and it achieved this by limiting the tax relief to be given through MIRAS to the basic rate of tax.
In the 1983 Budget Geoffrey Howe increased the size of loans eligible for tax relief on interest from £25,000 to £30,000. It had previously been announced that MIRAS would come into operation from  April 1983. Unmarried couples with joint mortgages could pool their allowances to £60,000, a provision known as Multiple Mortgage Tax Relief. This remained in place until the 1988 Budget, when Nigel Lawson ended the option to pool allowances from August 1988. Lawson later publicly expressed regret at not having implemented the change with effect from the time of the budget, as it is generally accepted that the rush to beat the deadline fuelled a sharp increase in house prices.


== Reduction and abolition ==
In 1994 the rate of relief was reduced by Kenneth Clarke, with further reductions in 1995 and 1997. MIRAS was completely abolished in April 2000 by Gordon Brown, who argued it had become a middle class perk.


== Republic of Ireland ==
There is a similar scheme in the Republic of Ireland, although not available for mortgages drawn down after 2013.

Capability_management,Start,1,"Capability management is a high-level management function, with particular application in the context of defense.
Capability management aims to balance economy in meeting current operational requirements, with the sustainable use of current capabilities, and the development of future capabilities, to meet the sometimes competing strategic and current operational objectives of an enterprise. Accordingly, effective capability management:

Assists organizations to better understand, and effectively integrate the total enterprise ability or capacity to achieve strategic and current operational objectives; and
Develops and provides solutions that focus on the management of the interlinking functions and activities in the enterprise's strategic and current operational contexts.
In military contexts, capabilities may also be analysed in terms of Force Structure and the Preparedness of elements or groupings within that Force Structure. Preparedness in turn may be analysed in terms of Readiness and Sustainability.
In both the military and commercial contexts, net-centric operations and related concepts are playing an increasingly important role in leading and driving business transformation, and contemporary capability management needs to have close regard of those factors.  The level of interoperability, both technical and organisational/social, is a critical determinant of the net-centric capability that is able to be realised and employed.


== Capability management topics ==


=== Capability ===
Enterprises consist of a portfolio of capabilities that are used in various combinations to achieve outcomes. Within that portfolio, a capability will be transient unless managed and maintained over time.  Therefore, a typical capability lifecycle spans needs, requirements, acquisition, in-service and obsolescence/disposal phases.
While a highly developed management discipline within several national military organisations, the concepts, principles and practices of capability management are readily adaptable and effective for application in the strategy and operations of many other enterprises.


=== Defining capabilities in the US military ===
The Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System Manual, CJCSM 3170.01, states that definitions of identified capabilities must satisfy two rules:

Capability definitions must contain the required attributes with appropriate measures of effectiveness (e.g.: time, distance, effect [including scale] and obstacles to overcome).
Capability definitions should be general and not influence a decision in favor of a particular means of implementation. The definition should be specific enough to evaluate alternative approaches to implement the capability.

Capabilities are organized around concepts of operations (CONOPS), which describe how a specified course of action is to be executed. The ability to execute the specified course of action depends on many factors and the relationship between those factors. Capabilities can be described as one or more sequences of activities, referred to as operational threads. The threads are composed of a set of activities that can be grouped to form the basis for a mission area architecture. The architecture then provides the structure for defining and understanding the many factors that impact the capability. The figure illustrates this sequence of relationships.
The Navy has also endorsed using architectures to understand and analyze capabilities and their associated requirements. The Navy performs this architecture analysis based on the concept of Mission Capability Package (MCP). The intent is to consider all of the factors that contribute to the desired mission capability as an integrated system. An MCP is defined as ""a task-oriented bundle of CONOPS, processes, and organization structures supported by networks, sensors, weapons, and systems, as well as personnel training and support services to sustain a core naval capability."" The MCP and associated analysis then provide the basis for acquisition decisions.


=== Capability management considerations ===
Due to the complexities of system-of-systems integration, interoperability, and the dynamic nature of operations, capability management is greatly assisted by modelling and simulating realistic strategic scenarios and contexts, in order to inform business cases and decision-making.  Through those considerations and practices, the enterprise and its performance can be continuously assessed and projected into the future. 
Well executed capability management therefore clearly informs strategic and operational decisions, and aids in the development of diverse but well-considered strategic and operational options, so they are readily available off-the-shelf.  This should also endow significant agility to an enterprise, providing enhanced ""contingency capital"" and risk mitigation.
Capability management therefore centers on:

Strategic and operational appreciations and analyses
Capability conceptualization, definition and development
Operations research and analysis
Context or scenario-based capability modelling and simulation
Capability costing
Capital project business cases and management
Decision making and decision support
Capability assurance and performance management


== Capability management frameworks ==
The interlinking functions and activities of the enterprise may be defined under several best-practice paradigms or frameworks, such as the Balanced Scorecard, or the US Department of Defense Architecture Framework, The Ministry of Defence Architecture Framework, The Open Group Architecture Framework and Zachman's Framework for Enterprise Architecture. In other words, capability is typically managed and assessed with regard to several dimensions or integrative elements.


=== DOTMLPF ===
The US military analyses its capabilities in the dimensions of ""DOTMLPF"", being:

Doctrine
Organizations
Training
Materiel
Leader development
Personnel
Facilities
Interoperability concerns all capability dimensions, therefore NATO has extended the seven capability dimensions by the cross-cutting aspect of Interoperability and uses the acronym ""DOTMLPF-I"".


=== Defence Lines of Development ===
The UK Ministry of Defence uses a similar breakdown of Defence Lines of Development as follows:

Training
Equipment
Personnel
Information
Concepts and Doctrine
Organisation
Infrastructure
Logistics
The mnemonic ""Tepid oil"" is used to remember these.  Though not a Defence Line of Development in itself, the unifying theme of 'interoperability' is considered to ensure a holistic approach to capability integration.
The UK Ministry of Defence cites Interoperability as an overarching theme that must be considered when any Defence Line of Development is being addressed.


=== Fundamental Inputs to Capability ===
The Australian Defence Organisation also analyses its capabilities in similar dimensions - the so-called Fundamental Inputs to Capability. These are:

Command and Management
Organisation
Major Systems
Personnel
Supplies
Support
Facilities
Collective Training
Industry
These Fundamental Inputs to Capability must be integrated and managed within a defined or constraining financial envelope in order to realise and sustain a capability: a deficiency in any one adversely impacts the whole.

Motorized_recliner_incident,Start,1,"In 2009, Dennis LeRoy Anderson of Proctor, Minnesota, received widespread media attention for being arrested in a DUI case involving a motorized recliner. Riding a recliner which he had earlier fitted with a lawnmower engine, he crashed into a car after leaving a local bar, where he had consumed a number of beers. He was convicted and the chair was confiscated by the police, who auctioned it off on Do-Bid.com for $3,700. Though widely reported to be a La-Z-Boy, the chair was unbranded.


== Incident ==
62-year-old Dennis LeRoy Anderson fitted his recliner with a lawnmower engine, wheels and steering wheel, which allowed the chair to reach up to 20 miles (32 km) per hour. He had also installed a stereo, cup holders, headlights and a power antenna. On August 31, 2009, he left a local bar in Proctor, Minnesota, after having drunk eight or nine beers and crashed into a car in the parking lot. When the police picked him up, his blood alcohol content was measured at 0.29. Anderson was sentenced to 180 days in jail and was fined $2,000. The jail time, and half the fine, was made probational.
According to Minnesota law, a ""motor vehicle"" is taken to mean ""every vehicle that is self-propelled and every vehicle that is propelled by electric power obtained from overhead trolley wires"". This means that a driver of any motorized vehicle, even a recliner, is liable under DWI legislation. Anderson's blood alcohol content was three times over the legal limit for the state. Vehicles can be confiscated if the driver has a blood alcohol level over 0.2 or a DWI conviction from the last ten years,
both of which he did.


== Auction ==
On October 29, Proctor police put the seized chair up for auction on eBay, as a motorized La-Z-Boy. The auction was to run for five days, with an opening bid at $500. By November 2 – one day before bidding was to end – the item had reached $43,700. It was then that the police department was contacted by La-Z-Boy corporation pointing out that the chair was not their product and request that the description to be accordingly changed. The police had simply used the description employed by the media. The request was fulfilled but eBay pulled the item from their listings, and the listing had to start anew.
The chair was finally auctioned off successfully for a third time. A Duluth area resident placed the winning $3,700 bid. The chair had been put up for online auction twice before, but those sales fell through.

American_Autoflower_Cup,Start,1,"The American Autoflower Cup is an annual cannabis breeding competition founded by Jeremy Norrie in 2023. The event focuses on autoflowering cannabis and is held in Green Street in Los Angeles, California.


== History ==
The first American Autoflower Cup was held Green Street in Downtown Los Angeles from January 27–28, 2023. It was the first national breeding competition for autoflowering cannabis, with the first international autoflower breeding competition being the Autoflower World Cup, held annually in Barcelona, Spain. Prior to founding the American Autoflower Cup, Norrie had helped organize the Secret Cup and the Chalice Festival, two other cannabis-related events in Los Angeles.
The judges for the first American Autoflower Cup included Joey Burger, Daniel Morford, Nick Bradley, and Jenny-Beth Dillis. Fast Buds’ Strawberry Gorilla strain received the first prize in the sativa category. The Strawberry Gorilla strain from Fast Buds was also named the most potent strain in the competition, with a THC level of over 29% THC. Fast Buds’ Banana Purple Punch strain received the first prize in the indica category. Mephisto Genetics was named the best autoflower breeder.
The second American Autoflower Cup was held in February 2024. Industry professionals such as Haylo Autoflowers, Juvar from Dusa Farms, Blazin’ Skywalker, and Neil and Heaven from Highigan.
At the American Autoflower Cup, strains are judged according to categories such as appearance, aroma, taste, and the judge’s overall experience of smoking them. Cannabis testing labs Encore Labs and Leafworks test all entrant strains to ensure they fit the event’s requirements and are safe to consume.

TechOlympics,Start,1,"TechOlympics is an information technology (IT) conference for high school students. It connects students with IT professionals and with companies in order to promote the field of IT. The conference was originally held at the Millennium Hotel from 2010–2019, the Great American Ball Park in 2020 and 2023, virtually in 2021–2022 due to the global pandemic. The venue changed again to the Procter & Gamble Global Headquarters in Cincinnati for the 2024 event. The event is run by the INTERalliance of Greater Cincinnati, a non-profit organization seeking to empower students through a robust knowledge of IT. Colleges and other organizations are present at the event as well. Schools often attend as groups, but individual attendance is also permitted. The conference takes place over the course of one weekend, starting of Friday and going until midday Sunday. The events that take place during the conference fall into one of five categories: a Breakout, a Competition, a Workshop, a Showcase Demonstration, or a Speaker Presentation. However, there are other events that do not fit into one of these categories. Each year, the theme of the conference changes, and as such, so do the Breakouts and competitions offered, as well as the speakers presenting.


== Breakouts ==
TechOlympics offers the opportunity for students to learn from professionals through breakouts. Breakouts are talks that typically last one hour long and generally focus on IT. A selected list of topics covered in past breakouts is provided below.


== Competitions ==
TechOlympics is home to many competitions ranging from Wikiracing to competitive hacking. Below is a selected list of competitions.


== Showcase Demonstrations ==
A showcase project is large project that a group of students, often from the same school, take part in working on, in order to present the project to a panel of judges. This project is in competition with other projects to be the best project submitted. Winning this event is seen as a very important feat during the conference.


== Workshops ==
For the past few years TechOlympics has offered workshops, bringing in professionals to teach students a skill. A selected list of past topics can be found below.


== Speaker Presentations ==
Generally, after each meal, students will hear from a speaker, often one with an IT background, that discusses the merits of entering the IT field.


== Yearly Themes ==
In the first year, the event had no theme and was simply titled ""TechOlympics Expo 2010"". Subsequent years were similarly titled by the year they took place, until 2015, which began a tradition of declaring event themes, starting with ""Connect"".

Streatfeild_family,Start,1,"The Streatfeilds, Streatfields or Stretfields are an aristocratic English family of the landed gentry, from Chiddingstone, Kent. The family are traceable to the early 16th century and are a possible cadet branch of the Noble House of Stratford. They were significant landowners in Sussex, Surrey and Kent, and instrumental in shaping those counties throughout the 17th and 18th centuries. From the early 16th century until 1900 the family seat was Chiddingstone Castle. The family later sold the castle to Lord Astor in 1938.


== Notable members ==
Robert Streatfeild (1514 – March 1599) is claimed as the common ancestor of most living Streatfeilds and Streatfields.

The House of Stratford has a remarkably similar coat of arms attributed to them in the former half of the 14th century. This could be seen as evidence that the Streatfields, though their line cannot be traced beyond the 1500s, are in fact a cadet branch of the Stratford family, the name having been corrupted at some point prior to the 16th century.


== Reunion ==
In July 2014 a significant number of direct descendants of Robert Streatfeild met for a memorial service in St Mary’s Church, Chiddingstone, followed by a gathering at Chiddingstone Castle, home of many generations of Streatfeilds (having been expanded by Henry Streatfeild (1639-1709) from a house in the High Street to the Restoration style that it is now).

Managerial_grid_model,Start,1,"The managerial grid model or managerial grid theory (1964) is a model, developed by Robert R. Blake and Jane Mouton, of leadership styles.
This model originally identified five different leadership styles based on the concern for people and the concern for production.
The optimal leadership style in this model is based on Theory Y.
The grid theory has continued to evolve and develop. The theory was updated with two additional leadership styles and with a new element, resilience.
In 1999, the grid managerial seminar began using a new text, The Power to Change.
The model is represented as a grid with concern for production as the x-axis and concern for people as the y-axis; each axis ranges from 1 (Low) to 9 (High). The resulting leadership styles are as follows:

The indifferent (previously called impoverished) style (1,1): evade and elude. In this style, managers have low concern for both people and production. Managers use this style to preserve job and job seniority, protecting themselves by avoiding getting into trouble. The main concern for the manager is not to be held responsible for any mistakes, which results in less  innovative decisions.
The accommodating (previously, country club) style (1,9): yield and comply.  This style has a high concern for people and a low concern for production. Managers using this style pay much attention to the security and comfort of the employees, in hopes that this will increase performance. The resulting atmosphere is usually friendly, but not necessarily very productive.
The dictatorial  (previously, produce or perish) style (9,1): in return. Managers using this style pressure their employees through rules and punishments to achieve the company goals. This dictatorial style is based on Theory X of Douglas McGregor, and is commonly applied in companies on the edge of real or perceived failure. This style is often used in cases of crisis management.
The status quo (previously, middle-of-the-road) style (5,5): balance and compromise. Managers using this style try to balance between company goals and workers' needs. By giving some concern to both people and production, managers who use this style hope to achieve suitable performance but doing so gives away a bit of each concern so that neither production nor people needs are met.
The sound (previously, team) style (9,9): contribute and commit. In this style, high concern is paid both to people and production. As suggested by the propositions of Theory Y, managers choosing to use this style encourage teamwork and  commitment among employees. This method relies heavily on making employees feel themselves to be constructive parts of the company.
The opportunistic style: exploit and manipulate. Individuals using this style, which was added to the grid theory before 1999, do not have a fixed location on the grid. They adopt whichever behaviour offers the greatest personal benefit.
The paternalistic style: prescribe and guide. This style was added to the grid theory before 1999. In The Power to Change, it was redefined to alternate between the (1,9) and (9,1) locations on the grid. Managers using this style praise and support, but discourage challenges to their thinking.


== Behavioral elements ==
Grid theory breaks behavior down into seven key elements:

Jasper_White_(chef),Start,1,"Jasper Kenneth White Jr. (May 28, 1954 – May 11, 2024) was an American chef, restaurateur and cookbook author. He was considered to be a leading authority on the cuisine and food industry of New England, with a particular focus on seafood.


== Early life and education ==
Jasper White was born in Orange, New Jersey, on May 28, 1954. He credited his Italian grandmother with his interest in food.
White enrolled at The Culinary Institute of America in June 1975 and graduated in 1976.  In 1979, he met Lydia Shire, another aspiring chef. They worked together at many of the respected hotel dining rooms in Boston such as The Copley Plaza, The Parker House, and The Bostonian Hotel.  Shire considers White to be her mentor, and ""her best cook friend in the world.""


== Restaurants ==
In 1983, he opened Jasper's, a restaurant on Boston's waterfront. It was here that he ""carved out a niche in the local food scene deconstructing classics on his haute cuisine menu.""  It was described as ""a Boston, MA landmark famous for seafood and other New England specialties ... (leading) people who thought he was inextricably linked with upscale cuisine."" Jasper's closed in 1995; White closed the restaurant so he could spend time with his children.  For three years afterwards, he was a consultant to Legal Seafoods.
White opened Jasper White's Summer Shack in May 2000 in the Alewife section of Cambridge. The restaurant also has locations at Mohegan Sun and in Boston's Back Bay. There is a seasonal location on Spectacle Island in the Boston Harbor.  The Summer Shack allowed him to ""return to his culinary true love of hearty family-style cuisine: authentic and flavorful–not fussy (and) embrace his unpretentious roots.""  Even though it is meant to be like a seaside clam shack, one gourmet dish from Jasper's is on the menu, and it is the one for which he is most famous – pan-roasted lobster.  Summer Shack was sold to the Lyons Group in 2017 and White was no longer involved in the business.


== Personal life and death ==
White and his wife, Kathleen, lived with their children in the Greater Boston area. He died at a hospital in Boston from a ruptured intracranial aneurysm on May 11, 2024, at age 69.

Book_type,Start,1,"The book type is a field of four bits at the start of every DVD (in the physical format information section of the control data block) that indicates what the physical format of the disc is.  Many devices will use this field to determine how the disc should be treated.
One common cause of compatibility problems is the failure of a device to recognize the book type of the disc, most likely because the device had been manufactured before that particular book type was defined; for example, most DVD playback devices made before mid-2004 cannot recognize the relatively new DVD+R DL Book Type. For DVD+R, DVD+RW, and DVD+R DL discs, it is possible to change the book type field value to the value associated with the DVD-ROM format (or in some rare and unorthodox cases, even the value associated with the DVD-R format—though only DVD+R can be changed to this) in order to fool older devices, which is a trick known as bitsetting.

Indiana_Youth_Group,Start,1,"Indiana Youth Group (IYG) is a LGBTQ advocacy group based in Indianapolis Indiana, founded by Christopher T. Gonzalez. 


== History ==
The Indiana Youth Group was founded by Chris Gonzalez and his partner, Jeff Werner, in 1989. Chris Gonzalez worked as a counselor at the Gay and Lesbian Switchboard in Indianapolis. They found that queer youth in Indiana often needed guidance and a safe space to grow. Meetings started in the Damien Center, and eventually included educational and social gatherings. In 1991, they started to provide assistance to homeless youth. They created Indiana's first Gender and Sexuality Alliance Network in 2005 and reached out to Indiana University–Purdue University Indianapolis specifically around 2006. In 2007, the IYG formally took on the Indiana Youth Group title rather than the Indianapolis Youth Group and applied for a state license plate. They received the license plate in 2013 after a legal battle with the state. They moved to a location on North Meridian Street in 2017.
They offer programs aimed at aiding LGBTQ+ Youth in Indiana including case management, housing, clothing supplies, food pantry, counseling services, and social activities. Their counseling services is funded by the Colts Foundation.
In 2020, they created Project Prism for unhoused youth in Indiana. In 2021, IYG hosted a Thanksgiving meal for youth. In 2022, they created a youth camp called ""Queer Camp.""
They also provide services in Crawfordsville, Indiana.

Time_unit_box_system,Start,1,"Time Unit Box System (TUBS) is a simple system for notating events that happen over a period. This system is mostly used for notating rhythms in music. The notation consists of one or more rows of boxes; each box represents a fixed unit of time. Blank boxes indicate that nothing happens during that interval, while a mark in a box indicates that an event occurs at the start of that time interval.
TUBS is most useful for showing relationships between complex rhythms, such as polyrhythms, that would be difficult to see in traditional musical notation. TUBS also has the advantage that non-musicians can interpret it much more easily than musical notation, because of its simplicity.
The term ""TUBS"" and the notation was originally used by musicologists Philip Harland and James Koetting to notate polyrhythms in African music in the early 1960s.  However, Joseon composer Bak Yeon(박연)'s invention of similar but unrelated notation jeongganbo(정간보, image) to notate Korean court music dates back to middle of the 15th century.
TUBS notation has been adapted by several people; the most common adaptations use different symbols in the boxes to represent different sounds, for example different ways of hitting a drum or even different musical pitches. In fact, tracker notation is essentially TUBS rotated by 90 degrees.


== Examples ==
Below is an example in TUBS, followed by a similar representation in traditional music notation.


=== TUBS ===


=== Traditional ===

Below is an example of an adapted TUBS score depicting a percussion pattern for multiple instruments. One benefit with the TUBS system is that it clearly relates which drum is to be struck (as the symbol will be solid, hollow, etc. uniquely for each drum) as opposed to different drums being notated via a different line of the musical staff, which can be more difficult to see. More importantly, the symbol used inside of each Time Unit Box relates how the drum is to be struck (open tone, slap, bass, rim-shot, etc.) which is not as easily conveyed with the musical staff notation.

Fool's_Gold_(band),Start,1,"Fool's Gold is an American musical collective that combines Western pop with African and Middle Eastern music. The group started as a side project of musicians Luke Top (a vocalist and bassist) and Lewis Pesacov (lead guitarist), who set out to explore their shared love of various forms of African music (specifically Congolese, Ethiopian, Eritrean and Malian), Krautrock, and 1980s dance influenced pop music.


== History ==


=== Formation ===
The band was formed initially as a collaboration between Top and Pesacov in 2007. Top had immigrated to Los Angeles from Israel at age three and earned his B.A. in Music and Recording at SFSU. Pesacov earned a degree in classical music theory and composition while studying under American composers Mark Randall-Osborn and Franklin Cox. Joining their cultural and musical backgrounds, the two began writing songs together, many of which would eventually appear on their self-titled debut album in 2009.
Top has said that the band's name came from a trip he and Pesacov took to Northern California in which a mutual friend described a time when she found fool's gold in the ocean.
Fool's Gold expanded to a sizable band composed of numerous accomplished and unique musicians. Among the members joining Top and Pesacov were Garrett Ray, Jimmy Vincent and Matt Popieluch of Pesacov's other band, Foreign Born; Latin American pop star Erica Garcia; Orpheo McCord (former drummer for The Fall), Michael Tapper (formerly of We Are Scientists), and several others.
In late 2009, the band was chosen as of one Beyond Race Magazine's 50 Emerging Artists, resulting in a spot in the publication's No. 11 issue, as well as an exclusive Q&A for the magazine's site.
Fool’s Gold live shows have earned them invitations to The Hollywood Bowl, SummerStage, and the Black Sessions in Paris. Fool’s Gold have played events such as Glastonbury, Reading, Leeds, Oya, Austin City Limits Music Festival and London Calling Fest in Amsterdam. In 2011, they toured in England with The Red Hot Chili Peppers.


=== Fool's Gold debut album ===
The songs for the band's debut album Fool's Gold were mostly recorded live over a two-day session at the Sunset Lodge recording studio in Los Angeles in 2008; tracks were later completed in various apartment living rooms in the early parts of 2009. Top and Pesacov collaborated on the music, written over a three-year span. The lyrics of the album are almost entirely in Hebrew.
The album was released on September 29, 2009 through Los Angeles label IAMSOUND Records on both 12"" vinyl and compact disc formats; it was subsequently released worldwide on January 25, 2010.


=== Leave No Trace redefines the band ===
After many tours following the release of their self-titled debut, the once sizable collective organically evolved into a five-member band: vocalist/bassist Luke Top, guitarist Lewis Pesacov, drummer Garrett Ray, multi-instrumentalist Brad Caulkins, and percussionist Salvador Placencia. This line-up redefined their sound for their sophomore LP, Leave No Trace, much of which was written in Wonder Valley, California (an artist/musician collective in the Mojave Desert). It was recorded at infrasonic studios in Alhambra in East Los Angeles, according to Pesacov, who also produced the album. 
A notable distinction in Leave No Trace is that it is sung predominantly in English. This was an intuitive choice, much in the way the debut album leaned towards Hebrew. “Singing in Hebrew on the first record allowed me to find my voice; it helped me to come out of my shell and push myself into letting go, both as a performer and songwriter,” says singer Luke Top. “As the words and themes for this record started to take shape, I knew I had to express them in English, my first language. Being that this is a far more personal and nuanced collection of songs, it was important to me that my ideas were expressed as clearly as possible, both to myself and to the listener.”

305 Jefferson Street,Start,1,"305 Jefferson Street is a historic warehouse in Huntsville, Alabama.  It was built by grocery wholesaler W. L. Halsey circa 1925.  Halsey operated the warehouse until 1957, when it was sold and rented to other tenants, at times including a beer distributor and a Salvation Army storage facility.  It was subdivided into three units in the 1970s.  The brick building is rectangular, with the narrow side facing the street.  On the main façade, a double entry door is flanked by pairs of two-over-two sash windows.  The south side of the building has two large openings for the warehouse doors; these have since been replaced with glass doors leading to the middle unit.  Two of the three original sliding wood doors remain, and cover the glass entries in the middle unit.  More two-over-two windows are distributed along the south wall.  The rear originally had a warehouse door, now replaced by double glass doors, with a single two-over-two window on either side.
The area of Jefferson Street was known as ""Grocery Row"", due to the number of grocery, vegetable, and fruit warehouses on the block.  305 is adjacent to the Kelly Brothers and Rowe Building, which is next to the Lombardo Building, and is separated by a narrow alley from the Halsey Grocery Warehouse, and across the street from the W. L. Halsey Warehouse.  The buildings lie one block south of the Huntsville Depot.
The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003.

Bookshelf_speaker,Start,1,"A bookshelf loudspeaker (or bookshelf speaker) is a compact loudspeaker, generally sold for consumer-grade home audio applications as part of a shelf stereo pair or home theater package, that is compact in size and intended to be placed on a raised surface, e.g. a bookshelf.


== History ==
In the 1950s and 1960s, high quality home loudspeakers were exclusively large and floor-standing speaker enclosures, whereas small speaker cabinets had reputation of low price and low audio quality. Beginning in the 1960s, some manufacturers began making more expensive, compact high fidelity speakers. The demand for smaller speakers was from hifi enthusiasts who lived in small apartments, who did not have space for large speaker enclosures. 
Edgar Villchur, who along with partner Henry Kloss founded Acoustic Research, is generally credited with inventing bookshelf speakers.  Villchur's key innovation was an acoustic suspension (also called ""sealed box"") design, by which the woofer and other drivers were in separately enclosed chambers. The speaker drivers were stiffer and much smaller than the earlier ported designs. The acoustic suspension design enabled the air in the sealed box to act like a spring, to help prevent excessive excursion.  Advent, now defunct, was another early manufacturer of bookshelf speakers.
Certain market and technical issues have contributed to the widespread adoption of bookshelf speakers in the 1990s and beyond.  Technical improvements and less expensive mass-production technologies have made high-quality bookshelf speakers affordable for most audio enthusiasts.  Rapid improvements in amplifiers, digital signal processors and other components has improved the sound quality of low to mid-level home audio systems, which creates a stronger need for adequate speakers.  
Home theater systems are increasingly popular, and their multi-channel audio requires five or more speakers rather than the two speakers of earlier stereo systems.  For cost and practical reasons the most common setup is satellite speakers, typically bookshelf speakers for the side, back, and sometimes the front and center channels, rather than larger speakers for each channel.  
Finally, most home theater and many musical home audio applications, began in the late 1990s to incorporate separately-enclosed subwoofers to handle deep bass.  Human perception of low-frequency sound is relatively non-directional, so a single subwoofer cabinet placed anywhere in the room (even hidden behind a sofa) is usually sufficient and may be placed anywhere.  This frees up the other speakers to omit the lower end of the frequency spectrum. Without the relatively heavy, bulky, and expensive low bass drivers and their large speaker enclosures, the speakers can be made smaller.

Sweep_frequency_response_analysis,Start,1,"Sweep frequency response analysis (SFRA) is a method to evaluate the mechanical integrity of core, windings and clamping structures within power transformers by measuring their electrical transfer functions over a wide frequency range.  


== Methods ==
SFRA is a comparative method, meaning an evaluation of the transformer condition is done by comparing an actual set of SFRA results to reference results. Three methods are commonly used to assess the measured traces:

Time-based – current SFRA results will be compared to previous results of the same unit.
Type-based – SFRA of one transformer will be compared to an equal type of transformer.
Phase comparison – SFRA results of one phase will be compared to the results of the other phases of the same transformer.


== Process ==
Transformers generate a unique signature when tested at discrete frequencies and plotted as a curve. The distance between conductors of the transformer forms a capacitance. Any movement of the conductors or windings will change this capacitance. This capacitance being a part of complex L (inductance), R (Resistance) and C (Capacitance) network, any change in this capacitance will be reflected in the curve or signature.
An initial SFRA test is carried out to obtain the signature of the transformer frequency response by injecting various discreet frequencies. This reference is then used for future comparisons. A change in winding position, degradation in the insulation, etc. will result in change in capacitance or inductance thereby affecting the measured curves.
Tests are carried out periodically or during major external events like short circuits and results compared against the initial signature to test for any problems.


== Problem detection ==
SFRA analysis can detect problems in transformers such as: 

winding deformation – axial & radial, like hoop buckling, tilting, spiraling
displacements between high and low voltage windings
partial winding collapse
shorted or open turns
faulty grounding of core or screens
core movement
broken clamping structures
problematic internal connections


== Uses ==
SFRA can be used in the following contexts:

To obtain initial signature of healthy transformer for future comparisons
Periodic checks as part of regular maintenance
Immediately after a major external event like short circuit
Transportation or relocation of transformer
Studying earthquakes
Pre-commissioning check

Extended_parallel_process_model,Start,1,"The extended parallel process model (EPPM) is a fear appeal theory developed by communications scholar Kim Witte that illustrates how individuals react to fear-inducing messages. Witte subsequently published an initial test of the model in Communication Monographs.
The EPPM was developed by Witte as a response to the significant inconsistencies in fear appeal literature, serving as an extension of previous fear appeal models, hence the use of 'extended' in name 'EPPM'. The model is originally based on Leventhal's Parallel Process Model – a danger and fear control framework that studied how adaptive protective behaviour stemmed from attempts of danger control. It also significantly draws from Roger's Protection motivation theory, which proposes two responses to fear-inducing stimuli: threat appraisal and coping appraisal.
The model's main theory is that when confronted with a fear-inducing stimulus, humans tend to engage in two simultaneous ways of message processing: a perceived efficacy appraisal (cognitive processing) and a perceived threat appraisal (emotional processing). Differences in message appraisal then lead to two behavioural outcomes, with individuals engaging in either a danger control process or a fear control process. In the case of the message being perceived as having no element of threat, individuals do not exhibit a response, and the message is ignored. The EPPM states that the danger control process leads to behavioural change, while the fear control process does not.
Witte's EPPM expands on previous fear appeal studies by explaining the reasons for failure in fear appeals and reincorporating fear as a central variable in the model. This is also the first fear appeal model that outlines the relationship between threat and efficacy in propositional forms.
The EPPM concludes that a fear control process leads to message rejection, while a danger control process leads to message acceptance, leading to adaptive behavioural changes.


== Background ==
Witte's motivations for designing an updated fear appeal model was due to the declining role of fear in fear appeals. While initially, fear was the pinnacle of theoretical fear appeal literature, it was starting to be considered as a control variable in subsequent models. A lack of precision in the Parallel Process Model and empirical inconsistencies in the Protection Motivation Theory were also noted by Witte as reasons for formulating an extended parallel process model.
Two main components of large-scale public messaging that induce behavioural change are fear appeals and fear appraisals. Fear appeals are specifically designed to elicit fear and nudge individuals to adapt to the recommendations in the message. They find their use in public health campaigns and political adverts, and are designed to fit three main categories: message, behaviour, and the audience.

Message: The content that is included in the fear-inducing message
Behaviour: The behavioural response recommended by the message
Audience: The characteristics of the audience receiving the message
Fear appraisals are the mental evaluations made in response to experiencing fear-inducing stimuli and are also known as threat appraisals. Fear appeal literature is primarily focused on understanding key fear appraisal processes in humans, with the intention of using it to drive social campaigns and behavioural interventions. 


== Components ==
The EPPM uses persuasive fear-inducing messages to induce intended behavioural responses. Wittle details three main processes involved in fear appraisal: the fear appeal inputs, the message processing of the inputs, and the outputs, or action taken after evaluating the perceived threat.


=== Fear appeal inputs ===
According to fear appeal studies, a fear appeal has two components: a component of threat and a component of efficacy. These two components are further divided into two categories each. The threat component is composed of severity and susceptibility, while the efficacy component is composed of response efficacy and self-efficacy.
These four key factors, as defined by the EPPM, predict the likely outcome of communications that involve a fear appeal.
Threat variables

Susceptibility – The perception the individual has of how likely the threat is to impact them.
Severity – The perception the individual has of the magnitude of the threat.
Efficacy variables

Self-efficacy – The perception the individual has that they are competent to perform the tasks needed to control the risk.
Response efficacy – The perception the individual has that the action, if carried out, will successfully control the risk.
The outcome of fear appeals is determined by an appraisal, that is, the evaluation of the message as either dangerous or indifferent.


=== Fear appraisal ===
Appraisal Theory states that an individual makes either an emotional or affective response to external stimuli. The EPPM outlines two primary appraisals an individual makes in response to a fear appeal: a threat appraisal, followed by an efficacy appraisal.

Low threat appraisal
When a threat appraisal is perceived to be low, i.e., there is a lack of imminent threat, the fear appeal is rejected immediately.
Moderate to High threat appraisal
When a threat appraisal is perceived as moderate or high, fear is induced, and individuals begin the efficacy appraisal.
Low efficacy appraisal
When the efficacy appraisal is perceived to be low, the message does not induce behavioural change.
Moderate to High efficacy appraisal
When the efficacy appraisal is perceived as moderate or high, the message induces a behavioural change.
After appraisals of the fear appeal, individuals then take action based on whether the threat is imminent or trivial.


=== Fear Appeal Outputs ===
The EPPM predicts three possible outputs after the fear appraisal is carried out:

Danger control
When an individual perceives that the severity and susceptibility are high (i.e., high threat appraisal) and also perceives that they are competent to take mitigating action (i.e., high efficacy appraisal), then they are likely to act to control the danger.
Fear control
The model predicts that if an individual perceives their ability to control risk as low, even if the severity and susceptibility are perceived as high, they are likely to take steps to control their fear instead. Fear control responses are defined as coping mechanisms that reduce fear and include denial, psychological reactance and defensive avoidance. These are maladaptive changes, or counterproductive behaviours. Fear controlling behaviour may involve the use of cognitive defence mechanisms such as ""It will happen to me sooner or later"", in order to manage the state of anxiety.
No Response
The severity or susceptibility of the danger is perceived as low, and the individual rejects the message. There is no behavioural change.


== Applications ==
The EPPM model is mainly used in social and behaviour change communication (SBCC). Practitioners design a general communications program, such as a campaign or an advert, and then test the effectiveness of the program through implementation. SBCC methods in healthcare, education, and marketing have employed the EPPM to induce behavioural change in patients and customers.
Multiple versions of the EPPM are employed in health campaigns. For example, EPPM-based campaigns have helped increase colorectal cancer screening participation among young adults and increased HPV vaccination interest among LatinX. 
Other usages of EPPM lie in shaping public perceptions, such as in political adverts, climate change messages, and pandemic responses. 


== Criticisms ==
While the EPPM has been effective in health campaigns and behavioural change interventions, there are limitations that have been pointed out through rigorous meta-analytical studies. 
Reviews have highlighted the many applications of the EPPM model in its 20 years since initial publication  but significant theoretical questions on the operationalization of key constructs remain and not all of its hypotheses have received empirical support.
Lucy Popova's 'The Extended Parallel Process Model: Illuminating the Gaps in Research', is an extensive review on the theoretical and empirical applications of the EPPM.  Popova discovered that the strong theoretical foundations has some inconsistencies in a few of its operational definitions. A systematic review of existing literature on EPPMs found that its propositions had no clear empirical support. The outcomes of fear appeals differ slightly from what the EPPM claims. This questions the practical validity of the EPPM.

The_Limit_Club_(band),Start,1,"The Limit Club is an American psychobilly / punk rock band from Phoenix, Arizona, formed in 2005.  The band consists of lead vocalist/guitarist Nick Feratu, upright bassist NickDave, drummer Niko J. and guitarist Miranda Duffy.
The band name was inspired by the song ""The Limit Club"" from The Damned's ""Friday the 13th"" EP.


== History ==
The Limit Club first formed in 2005 with members Nick Feratu, George and Cadaverous Joel.  They began to write and compose songs, which would be released on the album God Damn the Limit Club in 2007.  The band choose to remain independent, recording and releasing the album themselves.  After its completion, George decided to leave the band to focus on his education. The band recruited drummer Juan Carlos shortly after George left, and completed a short West coast tour in support of their then new album.
In September 2008 the band pounded out another album, entitled Phantom Cats. Around this time, The Quakes, an American Psychobilly band based in Phoenix, recruited Juan Carlos to play drums for them. This position would influence Juan's playing style from a standard sit-down drumkit, to working as an upright drummer. Tensions came to a boiling point within The Limit Club and Cadaverous Joel was asked to leave. Nicholas David (NickDave) was then recruited to fill the position of bassist.
In July 2009 the band completed a full West coast tour where they debuted much of their new material that would later find its way into the new album This is Cutthroat Business. In 2010, Juan Carlos relinquished his position with The Quakes to focus on the Limit Club.  Work on the upcoming album proceeded slowly, and ""Cutthroat Business"" wasn't fully recorded, mixed and released until March 2011.  The extra time was not in waste, for this proved to be the most professional album yet.  They filmed their first music video in June 2011 for the single ""Shake"" from ""Cutthroat Business"" (directed by Elijah Bustos/UCB Productions). The band hooked up with friends The Henchmen and organized a full US tour in the summer of 2011.  A success, the band gained wide exposure among fresh music scenes nationwide.
In October 2011, the band experimented with an expanded live show, featuring backing keyboards, trombone, second guitar and second drums with support from the band Manual Sex Drive. Shortly after, they officially added Monty O'Blivion to their lineup, on auxiliary guitar and backing vocals. 2012 brought a rush of activity, with two Western U.S. tours and filming of a music video for the song ""Condemned Vessel"" (Jeff Niemoeller/Ryan Hale).
In September 2013, the band organized and completed their first European tour, playing sixteen shows in seven different countries throughout the UK and Europe. In the late Spring of 2014, The Limit Club released a four-track vinyl EP entitled ""Wild Four"".
In 2015, the band celebrated their tenth anniversary by touring the American Midwest and East Coast in July 2015, followed by a monthlong tour of Europe in September 2015. The two tours took the band to Chicago, New York, Detroit, Cleveland, Boston as well as far off locales such as France, Germany, Austria, Romania and Slovenia. In October 2015, the Limit Club opened night one of Tiger Army's sold out Octoberflame VII at the Observatory in Santa Ana, CA.
In 2017, the band gained two new members; Niko J. on stand-up drums and vocals and Miranda Duffy on guitar and vocals. With the new lineup, the band recorded their fourth full length album entitled ""Kid Bitchin'"" over the summer of 2017 first half of 2018. The album was recorded in San Diego, CA with Kenny Hill (Guitarist with AK, formerly of the Quakes, Blackjackits) and in Tempe, AZ with Derrick Fish at FC Studios. The album was mastered by Rene De Le Muerte of the Brains and Nekromantix.

Velostat,Start,1,"Velostat, also known as Linqstat, is a packaging material made of a polymeric foil (polyolefins) impregnated with carbon black to make it somewhat electrically conductive. It is used for the protection of items or devices that are susceptible to damage from electrostatic discharge. It was developed by Custom Materials, now part of 3M. Velostat is a U.S. registered trademark (4,964,564) of Desco Industries Inc. Desco Industries purchased the assets of the 3M Static Control business on January 2, 2015.
Velostat is piezoresistive; its resistance changes with flexing or pressure. For instance, 25 mm2 of 0.2 mm fresh Velostat sandwiched between two electrodes has a resistance around 9 kΩ without any force applied, but only 1 kΩ when 3 Newtons of force is applied. For material that has been used, those resistances are roughly halved.
Velostat's low cost and piezoresistive properties have made it popular for making inexpensive flex or pressure sensors for microcontrollers. One example is shoes which light up when the wearer steps. Since Velostat's resistance is reduced when pressure is applied, a voltage divider measuring that resistance can indicate when weight is applied or removed from the shoes.

The event is conducted by the national governing body of the sport, currently USA Wrestling.


== Standards ==
To represent the United States at the Summer Olympic Games, an American wrestler must qualify nationally by winning the US Olympic team trials tournament, and internationally, by either placing fifth or higher at the previous year's World Championships or by becoming a finalist at the Pan American Olympic Qualifier or at a World Olympic Qualifier. The athlete who qualifies their weight class for the Summer Olympics is not guaranteed of a spot in the team, as he must qualify nationally. In case of an athlete qualifying nationally but failing to qualify the weight class internationally, the United States will not be represented at the Games.


== History ==
The first edition of the US Olympic team trials for wrestling took place from June 16 to 23 of 1984, when USA Wrestling dictated they would no longer select the wrestlers they sent to the Summer Olympic Games or the World Championships, as they would now hold an event where qualifying would now be on the hands of the athletes. Bob Dellinger, tournament operations director for the organization, expressed:

""We have brought these ladder challenges the actual final trials for the Olympic team out of a training camp situation and have placed them before the public. Many times in the past, the qualifying tournaments were sold to the public as ""final trials,' when in reality the team was selected in the seclusion of a training camp. These are not selections, they are trials. The decisions will be made on the mat, by athletes who have been training hard for a year or more for this opportunity. Our fans deserve the right to watch the Olympic team take shape.""

The_Golden_Chain,Start,1,"The ""Golden Chain"" is a list of names that was seized in March 2002 in a raid by Bosnian police of the premises of the Benevolence International Foundation in Sarajevo. The Golden Chain is a list of sponsors of Al-Qaeda.
The list included twenty-five names, twenty of them very wealthy Saudis and Gulf States financial sponsors including bankers, businessmen, and former ministers. Part of the list includes a computer file titled ""Tarekh Osama"" or ""Osama History"", but the appellation ""Golden Chain"" itself is due to al Qaeda defector Jamal al-Fadl, who vouched for its authenticity. The computer file contained photographs of the birth and early days of al-Qaeda as well as letters and documents, some in bin Laden's handwriting. In the seized material, records were found of both the plans for al-Qaeda's activities and its organizational structure and operational foundations.  These are believed to have been prepared by bin Laden and his mentor Sheikh Abdallah Azzam.
They also found a list of 20 Arab plutocrats, the “Golden Chain”, who were suspected of financing international terrorism, including al-Qaeda. The custody of the secret and confidential material was entrusted to bin Laden's confidant Enaam Arnaout, who was convinced that the documents were in the safest and most secure place in the Sarajevo office of the Benevolence International Foundation. During a search of the Benevolence International Foundation's offices in Sarajevo, the relevant law enforcement agencies found clear evidence of a connection between the head of the office, Enaam Arnaout, and Osama bin Laden, and of “militant” subordination between the two, and charges were brought against Arnaout.
Most accounts are vague on what year the Golden Chain document was written; some say 1988 but U.S. counter-terrorism advisor Richard A. Clarke says it dates from 1989. The ""Golden Chain"" was presented by the U.S. government in the criminal case United States v. Arnaout filed on January 29, 2003, and in other legal filings.
The American government has never publicly released the full document, and so the full list of names is a matter of conjecture and speculation. In 2003, the Wall Street Journal reported that it included ""billionaire bankers Saleh Kamel and Khalid bin Mahfouz, as well as the Al-Rajhi family, another banking family, and Mr. bin Laden's own brothers."" Minutes of the Sarajevo meeting on 11 August 1988 confirmed that bin Laden had begun his jihadist movement at that time. Bin Laden decided to recruit members and raise funds from Saudi Arabia. To carry out his jihadist war, he had to enlist the wealthy plutocrats of the Gulf, the “Golden Chain”, to fund al-Qaeda. The “Golden Chain” was a copy of a handwritten 1988 draft listing the wealthy financiers of the mujahedin's operations in Afghanistan, known within al-Qaeda as the “Golden Chain”. At the top of the document, translated from Arabic by the US Department of Justice, was a quote from the Koran: 'And spend in the cause of God'.

A free group has cohomological dimension one. As shown by John Stallings (for finitely generated group) and Richard Swan (in full generality), this property characterizes free groups. This result is known as the Stallings–Swan theorem. The Stallings-Swan theorem for a group G says that G is free if and only if every extension by G with abelian kernel is split.
The fundamental group of a compact, connected, orientable Riemann surface other than the sphere has cohomological dimension two.
More generally, the fundamental group of a closed, connected, orientable aspherical manifold of dimension n has cohomological dimension n. In particular, the fundamental group of a closed orientable hyperbolic n-manifold has cohomological dimension n.
Nontrivial finite groups have infinite cohomological dimension over 
  
    
      
        
          Z
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} }
  
.  More generally, the same is true for groups with nontrivial torsion.
Now consider the case of a general ring R.

A group G has cohomological dimension 0 if and only if its group ring 
  
    
      
        R
        G
      
    
    {\displaystyle RG}
  
 is semisimple. Thus a finite group has cohomological dimension 0 if and only if its order (or, equivalently, the orders of its elements) is invertible in R.
Generalizing the Stallings–Swan theorem for 
  
    
      
        R
        =
        
          Z
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle R=\mathbb {Z} }
  
, Martin Dunwoody proved that a group has cohomological dimension at most one over an arbitrary ring R if and only if it is the fundamental group of a connected graph of finite groups whose orders are invertible in R.


== Cohomological dimension of a field ==
The p-cohomological dimension of a field K is the p-cohomological dimension of the Galois group of a separable closure of K.  The cohomological dimension of K is the supremum of the p-cohomological dimension over all primes p.


== Examples ==
Every field of non-zero characteristic p has p-cohomological dimension at most 1.
Every finite field has absolute Galois group isomorphic to

Payment_by_results,Start,1,"Payment by results (PbR) is a type of public policy instrument whereby payments are contingent on the independent verification of results. It is being actively promoted by a number of governments for more effective implementation of domestic policy. 
There is also increasing interest in the field of international development, where PbR is often referred to either as ""results-based aid"" (where the funding relationship is between a donor and a recipient country) or ""results-based financing"" (where the funding relationship is between a developing country government or a development agency, and public or private sector providers). There are also a number of other terms in use which can often lead to confusion and a lack of clarity.
PbR instruments have three key features:

Payments for pre-agreed results
Recipient discretion over how the results are achieved
Independent verification as the trigger for disbursement


== Domestic policy ==
There are many cases of PbR models being used to achieve domestic policy goals, in particular the delivery of social or community services, with payments linked to the results a provider achieves, rather than its inputs and processes. The use of PbR models is often promoted as a way to drive service improvements and achieve increased value for money by aligning incentives to desired outcomes.
In practice, a diverse range of PbR models have been implemented by governments, varying by the degree to which:  

Payments can be based on the achievement of pure outcomes
Risk can be transferred away from government and towards providers
The purest form of PbR is payment by outcomes, which seeks to maximise payments linked to outcomes. This is where the commissioner (central or local government) is fully able to contract in terms of the outcomes it wants and to transfer the financial risk of non-delivery to providers. However, commissioners may face a number of challenges that may make a pure payment by outcomes approach either impractical or sub-optimal in terms of achieving the aims of PbR models. These challenges largely stem from commissioners’ ability to manage different risks and responsibilities, especially in relation to their understanding of desired outcomes and their measurement. 
Challenges can include outcomes only being delivered beyond the provider or investor’s return horizon, meaning an earlier payment or proxy outcome must be used; having sufficient confidence that the cash savings used to fund the payment of outcomes will ultimately be realised (e.g. that a reduction in re-offending translates to a reduction in prison capacity); finding a contractual solution that ensures transactional costs are reasonable; and determining how far the delivery of outcomes is attributable to the actual intervention rather than other services or background factors. Commissioners may also find providers are reluctant to accept all of the delivery risk (e.g. where there is a dependency on future government actions or policies) or where government cannot truly transfer all of the delivery risk.
There are no known cases where all government services are commissioned out. Furthermore, PbR will not always be the optimal contracting model, especially where in-house delivery is more appropriate, or where greater control is required over the service to be delivered.


=== Education ===
Payment by results was introduced in the management of British schools in June 1862.    National funding for individual schools, eventually rising to about half, depended in part on the outcomes of examinations of the pupils conducted by school inspectors. The system was deeply unpopular with teachers and led to increased unionisation.  The system was abandoned in 1890.


=== National Health Service ===
A national tariff was introduced to the British NHS in 1990 and operated in the English NHS until 2020, prescribed in the National Health Service Commissioning Board and Clinical Commissioning Groups (Responsibilities and Standing Rules) Regulations 2012.  Clinical Commissioning Groups, and NHS England are required to enter into standard PbR contracts with providers. Such a contract between an NHS commissioner and a hospital trust is compulsory for all services provided to NHS patients.  NHS improvement is required by section 116 of the Health and Social Care Act 2012 to produce a national tariff, which trusts must be paid for all the specified services.  There is provision for an increase to the tariff.  University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust was the first, and so far only one, in July 2015, to get an increase for its services agreed by Monitor (NHS) because of its ""increased costs associated with this trust running health services across multiple sites in rural locations"". It is paid more per episode for accident and emergency, surgery, trauma and orthopaedics, paediatrics, women's health, and non-elective medical conditions. This is expected to increase the trust's income by more than £20 million per year.
In  2019-20 a new  blended tariff with a fixed payment based on expected activity plus a risk share element was introduced for emergency care, and will be rolled out to other areas.
In March 2020 the payment by results system was suspended in the English NHS as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic in England and replaced by a system of block contracts.
According to Jeremy Hunt the payment by results system incentivises hospitals to maximise the number of operations they perform and disincentivises prevention of illness.


== International development ==
A range of different instruments in the field of international development can be characterized as PbR, many of which seek to provide incentives for the achievement of both outcomes and outputs by developing country governments, public agencies, commercial operators and civil society organizations. By linking disbursement to results, PbR is an alternative to the majority official development assistance (ODA), which is generally provided as grants, loans and guarantees, and is therefore disbursed in advance of delivery.
Proponents of PbR argue that this approach is more likely to deliver the desired development objective, with less scope for waste and greater freedom and incentive for the beneficiary to innovate or achieve the desired objective at least cost. Possible criticisms include the need for recipients to obtain pre-financing, the risk of unintended consequences, higher monitoring and verification costs, and the difficulty of setting the incentive at the optimum level (thereby leading to the risk of rent-seeking behavior).
Results-based aid is concerned with incentivizing national-level outcomes and involves the linking of ODA (e.g. from bilateral or multilateral development agencies to developing country governments) to verifiable results, such as performance against one or more outcome indicators, or the successful implementation of a government program. Possible outcomes might include number of children passing an exam, an improvement in the infant mortality rate, or the number of people with a defined improvement in access to energy. 
Results-based financing is concerned with the delivery of national or sub-national outputs, and could be used by developing country governments (national or local), public agencies, or development agencies as incentive for the provision of goods or services, create or expand markets, or stimulate innovation. Possible target outputs might include the number of vaccines administered, the number of teachers that are trained, the number of new electricity connections that are provided in a defined area. Results-based financing includes approaches such as output-based aid (OBA).
Existing examples of PbR programs include the Global Partnership on Output-Based Aid and Results-Based Financing for Health. However, interest in PBR in the international development sector is growing. The UK Department for International Development is piloting ""cash on delivery aid"" (a form of results-based aid) and results-based financing programs in a number of countries, the World Bank has recently launched program-for-results (PforR), a new results-based lending instrument, and the EU is exploring results-based approaches for the aid component of the multi-annual financial framework from 2014.

Asian_Music_Circuit,Start,1,"The Asian Music Circuit (AMC) is a UK-based organisation based which produces tours and concerts internationally, holds educational and outreach events in the UK and works generally to promote the music of Asia. Registered in Hemel Hempstead, its office and museum are based in West London. A registered charity funded by Arts Council England, the organisation celebrates twenty years since its incorporation in 2011, though it was initially founded in 1989. It is regarded as a leading promoter of pan-Asian music in England.


== Concerts and touring ==
Touring is the main activity of the AMC. Most prominent Asian performers have worked with the Asian Music Circuit, including Pandit Ravi Shankar, Anuradha Paudwal, The Kamkars, Fun-da-mental, the Naxi musicians of China and Asha Bhosle. The AMC has produced concerts in London's Royal Albert Hall as part of the BBC Proms, Royal Festival Hall and Wembley Arena, and also in the Sage Gateshead and at Manchester International Festival. It occasionally brings tours to Europe, the US and Asia.
The AMC brought Bollywood stars Shankar–Ehsaan–Loy to the Royal Albert Hall in September 2011 - the group's first-ever performance in the UK.


== Education and outreach projects ==
Every year, the AMC hosts a variety of workshops and courses for singers and instrumentalists, including khyal, tabla, dhrupad and ghazal. In partnership with the UK IMRs, the AMC sends artists to lead performance days with detainees. Working with local schools in West London, the AMC invites teachers to bring classes into its museum, or sends teachers to classrooms directly. Its foci have included the music of Afghanistan and poetry events.
Since 2010, the summer schools have been scaled down due to funding cuts.


== Museum of Asian Music ==
The AMC is based in its Museum in Acton was officially opened by The Prince of Wales in 2008.

Hamelin_Laie_International_School,Start,1,"Hamelin Laie International School is a private international school located in Montgat, Spain, near Barcelona. The school was founded in 1989 and teaches infant education, primary education, secondary education and baccalaureate. In 2022 it joined the family of private schools North Anglia Education. 


== History ==


=== Alella (1989-2014) ===
Hamelin-Laie is began as a family enterprise founded by the current school's president Sonia Sas's grandfather in the aftermath of the Spanish Civil War. It became the first school in the country to offer instruction in three languages – English, Spanish and Catalan – under the leadership of Sonia Sas's mother in 1989.The learning institution was originally located in the town of Alella. It consisted of two different buildings complexes: Hamelin and Laie. Hamelin, branded as orange, focused on early education (nursery and primary education). Its facilities were located in the historic building Vil·la Martorell. Meanwhile Laie, branded as deep blue, focused on secondary education. Both schools were part of the Escoles Sas group.


=== Montgat (2016-present) ===

In 2014 it was announced that the schools would be merging into Hamelin-Laie and the construction of a new campus on the near town of Montgat began. The building was carried out by the Alonso & Balaguer architecture studio (ABAA). In 2016 the facilities were completed. While now both Hamelin and Laie in a same building, they still remained with their own identity colors. Nevertheless, they abandoned their respective old logos and incorporated a new unified logo by Edgar Cueto.  


=== Nord Anglia Education (2022-present) ===
In 2022 Hamelin-Laie became part of Nord Anglia Education, being the second school in Spain. In consequence, the institution has access to the Nord Anglia Global Campus. While the school remained its name and overall branding its logo was redesigned to be more streamlined with the brand identity of Nord Anglia Education.


== Education ==
Hamelin Laie International School is a school approved by the MEC. In addition, in highschool it offers the National Baccalaureate and the International Baccalaureate (IB). The school has been an IB recognized institution since 2013. Within the school grounds there is the student residence Six Lemon World, the Hamelin Laie Language School and the Dance School Laie.

Call_transfer,Start,1,"A call transfer is a telecommunications mechanism that enables a user to relocate an existing telephone call to another phone or attendant console, using a transfer button or a switchhook flash and dialing the required location. The transferred call is either announced or unannounced.
If the transferred call is announced, the desired party/extension is notified of the impending transfer. This is typically done by putting the caller on hold and dialing the desired party/extension; they are then notified and, if they choose to accept the call, it is transferred over to them. Other terms commonly used for an announced transfer include ""attended"", ""consult"", ""full-consult"", ""supervised"" and ""conference"" transfer.
On the other hand, an unannounced transfer is self-explanatory: it is transferred without notifying the desired party/extension of the impending call. It is simply transferred to their line by way of a ""transfer"" key on the operator's phone or by keying in a string of digits which achieves the same function. Other terms commonly used for an unannounced transfer include ""unsupervised"" and ""blind"". Unsupervised call transfer can be either warm or cold - depending on moment when B-leg is disconnected.  See also Call forwarding


== Types of call transfers ==
In the Call Center space, the following type of call transfers can be undertaken and take on a slightly different meaning:

Warm transfer: (also known as a live or hot transfer) the call center operator dials a number and talks to the person who has picked up the call before transferring the caller over to them. This could also be a three-way conference before the call center operator drops-off. One common example of a warm transfer is when a receptionist or virtual receptionist takes a call for the business and notifies the party attempting to be reached who the person is and the nature of their call.
Tepid transfer: This involves the call center operator dialing a number and transferring the caller on to the called number without conferencing or speaking to the third party. Tepid transfer usually applies when a transfer is being made to a number where queue management has been implemented in some capacity (multiple lines or hunt groups, IVR, voicemail, callback facility etc.)
Cold transfer: This transfer is in reality not a transfer, but a pass-on of information for the caller to call a particular number after they hang up the current call. However, in certain instances a cold transfer may be implemented by calling the desired number on behalf of the caller, the original call handler/operator then drops-off without waiting for the called number to be picked up, whether or not the dialed number had queue management implemented or not.

Bell_housing,Start,1,"Bell housing or bellhousing is a colloquial term for the portion of the transmission that covers the flywheel and clutch or torque converter on vehicles powered by internal combustion engines. It keeps oil, water and other materials away from the clutch assembly. This housing is bolted to the engine block and derives its name from the bell-like shape that its internal components necessitate. The starter motor is usually mounted here, and engages with a ring gear on the flywheel. On the opposite end from the engine, the bellhousing is usually bolted to the gearbox. The use of different bellhousings on a transmission allows the same transmission to be used on multiple engines in multiple applications. However, on some transmissions, the bellhousing is a nonremovable part of the transmission case. This is particularly true with front wheel drive transmissions, which are much shorter than conventional rear wheel drive transmissions.

== History ==
In December 2013 Scottish Rugby launched its strategic initiative ‘Youth Rugby – A Strategy for Schools’. Former Scotland rugby coach Frank Hadden conducted the review for Scottish Rugby.
""In recent years youth rugby has had many changes in competition structure mainly based on the needs and wants of participating teams, some teams have thrived, some teams have struggled but change has been a constant and it is obvious that the current structure continues to be affected by; withdrawal of teams from leagues, weather, lack of competitive fixtures for some teams, a disjointed approach to fixturing, a reluctance by some to play on a regular basis. There is no doubt that the structure for youth rugby has reached a point where a radical change in approach is required to bring stability to our game.""

Nayadikali,Start,1,"Nayadikali (literally means hunting dance) is a traditional folk art form that exists among the Panan community of the Valluvanad region (present-day Palakkad, Thrissur districts) in Kerala, India. It is usually performed ahead of the Pooram festival at the Devi temples in the region, for the good and prosperity of the people and region.


== Performance ==
Nayadikali is a folk art form propagated since ancient times for the good and prosperity of the region. Ahead of the Pooram festival at the Devi temples, Nayadikali groups roam around homes in the region. Dressed up as people who go hunting in the forest, the Panan community goes from house to house and sings and plays. There are usually one to five people in a group. Their musical instruments used are two bamboo sticks, one will be long and the other will be short. The folk song is sung by holding the long stick in the left armpit and tapping it with a short stick.
They come wearing unique clothes on top of the mundus wrapped around their waists, with another mundu tied on their heads and painted different colors on their bodies. There will also be a cloth bag on the shoulder. They also carry a small wooden statue in their hand, called Ittingalikutty. This statue is placed in the courtyard and danced around it by beating the stick to and fro. They usually sing hunting related songs along with it. There is also a habit of making up own songs and singing them on the spot.
After the Nayadikali, rice, paddy and money will be given to the performers from the homes. On the day of Pooram, all groups reach the temple and play the finale performance. They also perform a kind of puppet show with the wooden puppet in their hand.

Landing_performance,Start,1,"The performance data for landing an aircraft can be obtained from the aircraft's flight manual or pilot's operating handbook. It will state the distance required to bring the aircraft to a stop under ideal conditions, assuming the aircraft crosses the runway threshold at a height of 50 ft, at the correct speed. The actual landing performance of an aircraft is affected by many variables which must be taken into account.


== Factors affecting landing performance ==


=== Weight ===
The weight of an aircraft is the primary factor that determines the landing distance required by an aircraft. An increase in weight increases the stall speed of the aircraft. Therefore, the  landing approach speed increases as the aircraft's weight increases. The kinetic energy (1/2 mV2) that has to be dissipated to stop an aircraft is a function of the mass of the aircraft and the square of its speed at touchdown. The kinetic energy increases significantly as an aircraft's weight increases, and the brakes have to absorb this greater energy, increasing the landing roll of the aircraft.


=== Density altitude ===
An increase in density altitude causes the True Airspeed (TAS) to be higher than the Indicated Airspeed. This increase in TAS leads to a greater touchdown speed and greater kinetic energy. More kinetic energy has to be absorbed by the brakes which necessitates a longer runway.


=== Headwinds and tailwinds ===
The headwind reduces the landing distance for an aircraft. Landing into a headwind reduces the ground speed (GS) for the same indicated airspeed (IAS). This is beneficial to pilots as well as Air traffic controllers (ATC). An aircraft landing into a  headwind will require less runway and will be able to vacate the runway sooner.
Tailwind increases the ground speed of an aircraft for the same IAS and thus a longer runway distance will be required for an aircraft to land. Landing with an unknown or unexpected tailwind could lead to the aircraft overshooting the runway.


=== Runway surface ===

Runway conditions affect take off and landing performance of an aircraft. The runway may be made up of concrete, asphalt, gravel or grass. An important safety concern at airports is the contamination of the runways due to ice, snow, water, rubber deposits etc. The landing distance required by an aircraft is much more in case of low friction runways which do not facilitate effective braking to occur. Aquaplaning is a phenomenon in which directional control is lost because of the presence of film of water between the rubber tires and the runway surface. The construction of grooved surface runways and regular maintenance, especially rubber removal, both help reduce runway slipperiness and facilitate good ground handling and effective braking.


=== Runway slope ===
An up-slope runway will allow an aircraft to land in a shorter distance. A down-slope runway will require a greater landing distance. It will take longer for the aircraft to touch down from 50 ft above the runway threshold, as the runway is falling away beneath the aircraft. Braking while going downhill is not as effective as on a level or up-slope runway.


=== Flap settings ===
Wing flaps are hinged surfaces on the trailing edge of the wings of a fixed-wing aircraft. High flap settings help an aircraft to increase the aerodynamic drag and reduce the stalling speed so that the aircraft can fly at low speeds safely. Flaps also lower the nose of the aircraft and give the pilots a better view of the ground ahead while landing.
