GDP_density,Stub,0,"GDP density is a measure of economic activity by area. It is expressed as gross domestic product per square kilometer and can be calculated by multiplying GDP per capita of an area by the population density of that area. Amongst other uses it demonstrates the effects of geography on economy.


== GDP Density ==


=== What is GDP density ===
GDP density refers to the distribution or intensity of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) within a particular area or population. GDP density could be interpreted as a measure of economic activity or output relative to the size of a region or population, often expressed as GDP per capita or GDP per unit of area.


==== GDP per capita ====
The GDP per capita is a commonly utilized indicator to assess a nation's economic performance. It is calculated by dividing the total value of products and services produced in a nation during a given time period by the average population of that nation. This measure, which is frequently used to compare the economic success of various countries, sheds light on the average economic output per person in a specific nation. GDP per capita typically denotes a higher standard of life because it shows that the nation's citizens have more resources and GDP density


==== GDP per unit area ====
GDP per unit area refers to the geographical distribution of Gross Domestic Product within a country. It analyzes how economic output is spread across different regions, provinces, states, or territories within a nation. Understanding GDP geographic distribution is essential for policymakers, businesses, and researchers as it provides insights into regional disparities in economic development and helps identify areas that may require targeted interventions or investment. Policymakers can identify economically underperforming regions and may need to implement tailored policies to promote growth and development by analyzing the geographic distribution of GDP. By identifying the areas of concentrated economic activity, it also assists firms in making well-informed decisions regarding the allocation of resources and market prospects. Additionally, trends of urbanization, economic resiliency, and regional growth are studied by scholars using geographic GDP density data.


== Fluctuations in GDP density ==
Academic discussions have highlighted two significant reasons why typical households might not benefit proportionally from economic growth. These reasons revolve around discrepancies between GDP per capita and median household income, shedding light on challenges in accurately measuring and interpreting economic indicators. The first reason centers on differences in measurement between GDP per capita, derived from national accounts, and median household income, based on household surveys. Despite efforts by organizations like the OECD and EU to align income measures with national accounts concepts, disparities persist due to methodological variations and mismeasurement. Empirical studies reveal substantial disparities between mean per capita income from national accounts and household surveys across various countries. The second reason gaining attention is the widening income inequality, where a significant portion of national income growth concentrates at the top of the income distribution. This trend results in minimal increases in the median income. Empirical studies, primarily focused on countries like the USA and the UK, underscore the impact of income inequality on household income dynamics.


=== Effect on poverty levels ===
Geographical detectors have been used, especially in rural poverty contexts, to systematically measure the individual and interacting influences of numerous factors on changes in GDP density. This investigation has found the ideal qualities of important variables that support GDP density growth. Furthermore, a better comprehension of the GDP density differentiation mechanism in rural poverty has been gained. Sufficient reasons for changes in GDP density in rural poverty have been established, based on variables like elevation, average yearly temperature, land use, normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI), and distance to main roadways. Crucially, it has been noted that these impact factors have interactive impacts on GDP density, with synergistic effects frequently producing nonlinear consequences and mutual enhancement.

Neighbourhood_forum,Stub,0,"Neighbourhood Forums are a construct of Local government in England and are defined in the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 as a body that organises the production of a neighbourhood plan.
Where town or parish councils exist those bodies may apply to the local planning authority (usually a district or borough council) for the devolution of neighbourhood planning powers. Where an area is unparished (usually because it is within a city or urban area) then local people may seek to create a neighbourhood forum and then apply to the local planning authority for its formal designation.
A designated neighbourhood forum is an organisation empowered by local planning authority to lead the neighbourhood planning process in the absence of a town or parish council.

Mid-term_adjustment,Stub,0,"In insurance, mid-term adjustment (MTA), also called a mid-term modification or mid-term change, refers to a change to an insurance policy prior to the end of the policy period (when coverage is offered).
The change to the policy may cause a change in the premium: an increase is often called AP (for an additional premium) whereas a decrease is often called RP (returned premium).
An additional transaction may also be payable to cover e.g. costs for revised insurance documents. Some insurers also use this fee to discourage changes, although few openly admit this.
A cancellation is often treated as a special-case MTA, where the cover decreases to zero. Such transactions may attract special fees too."

The Author is a certain functional principle by which, in our culture, one limits, excludes and chooses: ... The author is therefore the ideological figure by which one marks the manner in which we fear the proliferation of meaning.

For many, Foucault's lecture responds to Roland Barthes' essay ""The Death of the Author"".

Base_station_identity_code,Stub,0,"The base station identity code (BSIC) is a code used in GSM to uniquely identify a base station. The code is needed because it is possible that mobile stations receive the broadcast channel of more than one base station on the same frequency. This is due to frequency re-use in a cellular network. The BSIC is defined in GSM specification 03.03 section 4.3.2.
Each base station has its own BSIC. This code is at all times transmitted on the broadcast channel, so the mobile stations can distinguish between base stations. The BSIC is composed of a 3-bit network color code (NCC) and a 3-bit base station color code (BCC). The NCC is assigned to each network provider so the mobile station can sort out which base stations it is allowed to camp on. The NCC of different providers must be different; they must also be different in national border areas. The broadcast control channel (BCCH) of each base station is assigned a frequency by the network operator, and they must be assigned such that no neighbor stations have equal BCCH and thus equal BSIC.
As long as base stations use different frequencies for their broadcasting channel, there is no problem in using the same base station identity code. Unique identification of a base station is especially important in border areas, where at both sides of the border there is a different operator who might use the same broadcasting channel on the same frequency.

Castello_di_Gamberale,Stub,0,"Castello di Gamberale (Italian for Castle of Gamberale)  is a  Middle Ages castle in Gamberale, Province of Chieti (Abruzzo), Italy.


== History ==

The castle was constructed around the 12th century along with a church dedicated to Saint Michael, which later incorporated the entire fortress. In the previous century, there was already a small tower for observation, possibly Norman, which was expanded with the arrival of Neapolitan barons from Capua, who replaced the monks of Gamerrano.
The castle passed through the hands of various barons: initially owned by Raimondo d'Annecchino, it belonged to Giovanni Maria d'Annecchino in the 16th century. It was then owned by Giovanni Crispano and sold to Baron Giuseppe Mellucci for 500 ducats. It later passed to the Marquis Odoardo Benedetti, a nobleman from the province of L'Aquila, and finally, on April 14, 1777, it came into the possession of the Mascitelli family from Atessa, who were the last feudal lords of the area.
In the following centuries, the castle-fortress was used as a prison and a headquarters to dominate the valley. The church of Saint Michael was already in disrepair due to the damage from the 1706 earthquake, and the town was developing further down the valley, around the baronial casino Pollice and the church of Saint Lawrence, which was rebuilt in 1709.
By the early 1900s, the castle had collapsed and was partially rebuilt to house a nursery by the National Fascist Institute.
In 1943, during World War II, it was occupied by the retreating Nazis moving towards Castel di Sangro along the Gustav Line, becoming a strategic observation point over the Sangro valley. Due to Allied and German bombings, the structure was damaged, and the section overlooking the valley of Sant'Angelo del Pesco collapsed.
The subsequent 1984 earthquake caused the guard tower to collapse, which was reconstructed with modern elements, trying to replicate the original medieval appearance.
An inscription on the main facade notes that the castle was restored in 1881 thanks to Pasquale Bucci. Further restorations followed the damage from World War II and the 1984 earthquake, giving the castle its current pseudo-medieval appearance.


== Architecture ==
The castle has a central rectangular plan, with one side forming a semicircle, resembling an apse.
The stone bastions have survived centuries of destruction, as have the massive columns of the portico on the facade and the pavement of the square in front.

A widespread observation is that a great talent has a free spirit. For instance Pushkin, regarded by some scholars as Russia's first great writer, infuriated Russian officialdom and particularly the Tsar, since  instead of being a good servant of the state in the rank and file of the administration and extolling conventional virtues in his vocational writings (if write he must), composed extremely arrogant and extremely independent and extremely wicked verse in which a dangerous freedom of thought was evident in the novelty of his versification, in the audacity of his sensual fancy, and in his propensity for making fun of major and minor tyrants.

Atlas_method,Stub,0,"The Atlas method, employed by the World Bank since 1993, is utilized to estimate the economic size of nations in terms of their gross national income (GNI) in U.S. dollars.
To convert a country's GNI from its local currency into U.S. dollars, the Atlas conversion factor is employed. This factor incorporates a three-year average of exchange rates to mitigate the impact of temporary fluctuations in exchange rates. Additionally, it adjusts for the variance in inflation rates between the country in question (using its GDP deflator) and several developed nations (employing a weighted average of their GDP deflators in SDR terms). The resulting GNI in U.S. dollars is then divided by the country's midyear population to determine the GNI per capita.
The World Bank favors the Atlas method as a means of comparing the relative economic sizes of countries. It is utilized to classify nations into low, middle, and high-income categories, as well as to establish eligibility for lending purposes. By employing this method, the World Bank aims to minimize abrupt changes in country classification caused by short-term fluctuations.

Boost_gauge,Stub,0,"A boost gauge is a pressure gauge that indicates manifold air pressure or turbocharger or supercharger boost pressure  in an internal combustion engine. They are commonly mounted on the dashboard, on the driver's side pillar, or in a radio slot.
Turbochargers and superchargers are both engine-driven air compressors (exhaust-driven or mechanically driven, respectively) and provide varying levels of boost according to engine rpm, load etc. Quite often there is a power band within a given range of available boost pressure and it is an aid to performance driving to be aware of when that power band is being approached, in the same way a driver wants to be aware of engine rpm.
A boost gauge is used to ensure excessive pressure is not being generated when boost pressure is being modified to levels higher than OEM standard on a production turbocharged car. Simple methods can be employed to increase factory boost levels, such as bleeding air off the wastegate diaphragm to 'fool' it into staying closed longer, or installing a boost controller. To prevent the Air-fuel ratio from going lean (caused by increasing the boost beyond the fuel systems capacity) care must be taken to monitor boost pressure levels, along with oxygen levels in the exhaust gas, using an air-fuel ratio meter that monitors the oxygen sensor.
A boost gauge will measure pressure in psi, bar or kPa; many also measure manifold vacuum pressure in inches of mercury (in. Hg) or mm of mercury (mm Hg).

For example, The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood revised the folklore tale of Robin Hood to depict Robin as less ambiguously heroic, influencing all subsequent modern portrayals.
Many original works of fantasy appear to retell fairy tales in a revisionist manner.

Yliaster,Stub,0,"Yliaster or Iliaster, a term coined by Paracelsus, refers to ""prime matter, consisting of body and soul"".
Paracelsus described the Iliaster as the ""completely healed human being who has burned away all the dross of his lower being and is free to fly as the Phoenix."" It is most likely a portmanteau of the Greek hyle (matter) and Latin astrum (star). To Paracelsus, the Iliaster represented the two basic compounds of the cosmos, matter representing ""below"", and the stars representing ""above"". Paracelsus says this of the Yliaster while describing how fossils are trapped in wood:

Accordingly, the first body, the Yliaster, was nothing but a clod which contained all the chaos, all the waters, all minerals, all herbs, all stones, all gems. Only the supreme Master could release them and form them with tender solicitude, so that other things could be created from the rest.
In this sense, the Yliaster is the same as the Prima Materia. It is the formless base of all matter which is the raw material for the alchemical Great Work.
